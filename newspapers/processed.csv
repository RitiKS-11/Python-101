https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/furnace-explosion-at-chinese-owned-nickel-plant-in-indonesia-kills-at-least-13-and-injures-46-others,Furnace explosion at Chinese-owned nickel plant in Indonesia kills at least 13 and injures 46 others,2023-12-25 11:14,"A smelting furnace exploded Sunday at a Chinese-owned nickel plant on Indonesia's Sulawesi island, killing at least 13 workers and injuring dozens of others, police and a company official said.It was the latest in a series of deadly incidents at nickel smelting plants in Indonesia that are part of China's ambitious transnational development program known as the Belt and Road Initiative.Nickel is a key component in global battery production for electric vehicles.At least four Chinese and nine Indonesian workers died when the furnace exploded while they were repairing it, said Central Sulawesi police chief Agus Nugroho.The blast was so powerful it demolished the furnace and damaged parts of the side walls of the building, said Nugroho, adding that about 46 workers were injured, including 14 Chinese nationals, some in critical condition.Authorities are working to determine whether negligence by the company led to the deaths, Nugroho said.The accident occurred at PT Indonesia Tsingshan Stainless Steel, a subsidiary of PT Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park, known as PT IMIP, in the Bahodopi neighborhood of Morowali regency.""We sincerely apologize for this incident and we are working closely with authorities to investigate what caused the accident,"" said company spokesperson Deddy Kurniawan.Rescuers extinguished the fire and evacuated workers after a nearly four-hour operation, he added.In a statement released Sunday afternoon by the company, Kurniawan said the furnace was under maintenance and not operating at the time. However, ""residual slag in the furnace"" came in contact ""with flammable items"" driving the furnace walls to collapse and the remaining steel slag to flow out.Previously, the company said explosive liquids at the bottom of the furnace triggered a fire and a subsequent explosion in nearby oxygen cylinders.It was the third deadly incident this year at Chinese-owned nickel smelting plants in Central Sulawesi province, which has the largest nickel reserves in Indonesia.Two dump truck operators were killed when they were engulfed by a wall of black sludge-like material following the collapse of a nickel waste disposal site in April.In January, two workers, including a Chinese national, were killed in riots that involved workers and security guards at an Indonesia-China joint venture in North Morowali regency.Last year, a loader truck ran over and killed a Chinese worker while he was repairing a road in PT IMIP's mining area, and an Indonesian man burned to death when a furnace in the company's factory exploded.Nearly 50% of PT IMIP's shares are owned by a Chinese holding company, and the rest are owned by two Indonesian companies. It began smelter operations in 2013 and is now the largest nickel-based industrial area in Indonesia.Three Chinese workers in March filed a complaint to Indonesia's National Commission on Human Rights, alleging that their health is deteriorating due to dust and smoke exposure while working seven-day weeks without a break at PT IMIP. They added that workers there don't have adequate safety equipment.Data collected by the Mining Advocacy Network, an Indonesian watchdog, showed that at least 22 workers from China and Indonesia have died in nickel smelting plants in Central Sulawesi province since 2019, including two Chinese nationals who committed suicide.","['April', 'seven-day weeks', 'this year', 'January', '2019', '2013', 'Sunday', 'Last year', 'March']","['China', 'Morowali', 'Kurniawan', 'Indonesia', 'North Morowali']","['PT Indonesia Tsingshan Stainless Steel', 'PT IMIP', 'the Mining Advocacy Network', 'PT Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park', 'the Belt and Road Initiative', 'National Commission on Human Rights', 'Nugroho', 'IMIP']","['Deddy Kurniawan', 'Bahodopi', 'Central Sulawesi']",thehimalayantimes

He urged China to support Nepal's climate change agenda on the global stage.The PM also thanked the Chinese government for its initiatives to regularize the Nepal-China transit points, hoping for more support towards the smooth operations of such points in the days to come.Acknowledging the emergency assistance that Nepal received from China for the recent earthquake in the Karnali Province, the Prime Minister said, ""Nepal expects the cooperation from the Chinese government to develop the earthquake pre-information mechanism in Nepal"".He also thanked the northern neighbor for its readiness to operate the Lhasa-Kathmandu direct flight.PM Dahal reiterated that the 'one China' policy is Nepal's national policy.During the meeting, Prime Minister Dahal commended the economic progress made by China under President Xi Jinping's leadership and stated that the Belt and Road Initiative is his long-term initiation.The PM also on the occasion expressed sorrow over the passing away of China's former Premier Li Keqiang.The Chinese side informed PM Dahal that works remained to be completed on one terminal at the Lhasa Airport and the Lhasa-Kathmandu flights would be operated immediately after its completion.Similarly, Secretary Junzheng said that China wanted to work together with Nepal in the infrastructure, Nepal-China connectivity, economic development and tourism sectors in Nepal. Stating that promotion of people-to-people ties is the priority of Nepal, he said the exchange of visits between the two countries at different levels proved this.On the occasion, Secretary Junzheng expressed deep sorrow on behalf the Chinese government over the death of many people in the recent earthquake that struck Jajarkot and said that China was ready to extend additional relief support to the earthquake victims.He thanked Nepal for the 'one China' policy that it has been espousing since long, said the PM's press expert Timilsina.The PM Secretariat stated that discussions were also held during the meeting on implementing the agreements reached before this with China.Foreign affairs advisor to the PM, Rupak Sapkota, the Prime Minister's press advisor Govinda Acharya, among other officials were present in the meeting.Ambassador of China to Nepal, Chen Song and the members of the delegation were also present on the occasion.","['the days', 'today', 'November 30 to December 12 this year']","['China', 'Nepal', 'the United Arab Emirates', 'the Karnali Province', 'Lhasa', 'Sichuan Province', 'Kathmandu', 'Tibet']","['the Belt and Road Initiative', 'Manahari Timilsina', 'UN Climate Change Conference', 'trans-Himalayan Connectivity Network', 'Communist Party of China', 'PM Dahal', 'Timilsina']","['Junzheng', 'Govinda Acharya', 'Rupak Sapkota', 'Nepal', 'Xi Jinping', 'Li Keqiang', 'Jajarkot', ""Pushpa Kamal Dahal '"", 'Chen Song', 'Dahal', 'Wang Junzheng']",thehimalayantimes
https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/us-plans-to-build-a-553-million-terminal-at-sri-lankas-colombo-port-in-rivalry-with-china,US plans to build a $553 million terminal at Sri Lanka's Colombo port in rivalry with China,2023-11-09 12:43,"The U.S. announced a $553 million project Wednesday to build a deep-water shipping container terminal in Sri Lanka's Port of Colombo as it competes with China in international development financing.The project is billed as providing critical infrastructure for the South Asian nation with the potential to ""transform Colombo into a world-class logistics hub at the intersection of major shipping routes and emerging markets,"" according to the U.S. International Development Finance Corp.The DFC loan of $553 million for the West Container Terminal will ""expand its shipping capacity, creating greater prosperity for Sri Lanka - without adding to sovereign debt - while at the same strengthening the position of our allies across the region,"" said DFC Chief Executive Officer Scott Nathan.The announcement comes as Sri Lanka is struggling to recover from a dire financial and economic crisis.The Port of Colombo has been operating near its capacity since 2021, and the new terminal will cater to growing economies in the Bay of Bengal, the DFC said.The DFC will make a direct loan to the consortium developing the terminal, which is 51% owned by India's largest port operator, Adani Ports & Special Economic Zones Ltd. The other partners are Sri Lanka's John Keells Holdings, which has a 34% share, and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority with the remaining 15%.Nathan said that with the loan, Sri Lanka will be the ""2nd biggest exposure"" for his institution in the Indo-Pacific region, after India.""It's high priority for the United States to be active in the Indo-Pacific region,"" he told reporters in Colombo after visiting the site of the new terminal.The DFC was established five years ago in response to Beijing's massive global infrastructure building campaign, known as the Belt and Road Initiative. Through it, Beijing has invested tens of billions of dollars each year to build roads, railways, ports and airports, typically in developing nations, to foster trade and goodwill toward China.Some of those projects have raised controversy, among them Sri Lanka's Hambantota Port, on its southeastern coast. Sri Lanka borrowed heavily from China to build the port and other infrastructure including an airport and a city being built on reclaimed land. The projects have failed to earn enough revenue to pay for the loans, and in 2017, Sri Lanka leased the seaport in Hambantota to China.Sri Lanka's multibillion-dollar debts to Beijing have hindered efforts to resolve its financial woes and have often been cited as evidence by critics of the Belt and Road Initiative who claim China engages in debt-trap diplomacy.The Chinese government rejects such accusations. The debt trap argument was ""fabricated to disrupt and undermine China's cooperation with developing countries,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said during a daily briefing Tuesday.Both neighboring India and China are jostling for influence in Sri Lanka and both have already invested in expanding facilities at the Colombo port. India worries about a growing Chinese presence on the island, which is on one of the world's busiest shipping routes and in a region that India considers part of its strategic backyard.The Colombo port also has a terminal run by China Merchants Port Holdings. Another Chinese project, a luxury oceanside development spanning over 269 hectares of reclaimed land called Port City, is being built by CHEC Port City Colombo Co., a unit of China Communications Construction Company.The $1.4 billion project to build an integrated resort and casino and conference center zone, a marina, apartments, a business district and green space has raised concerns in Sri Lanka and India that the development could become a virtual Chinese outpost or colony.In development financing, the U.S. faces tough competition from Beijing, which has recalibrated its BRI initiative to be greener, safer and more sustainable, according to AidData, a research lab at William & Mary, a public university in Virginia.Nathan said that sustainability and ""local appropriateness"" are very important elements of the DFC's work.""We are not interested in giving money to projects that are not going to work,"" he said. ""Of course, sometimes, mistakes happen. But rarely.""He called the Sri Lanka port terminal project ""an investment in dynamics of the global economy, shipping and transshipment.""""My understanding is every time the capacity in the port of Colombo has increased, that additional capacity has been absorbed within just a couple of years,"" he said, adding that research indicated that is likely to continue.In a recent report, AidData said the U.S. is catching up with China in development finance after being overtaken by Beijing in total official financial flows to the developing world in 2007.The gap has narrowed recently as China scaled back its lending while the U.S. sharply raised loans through the newly launched DFC.The U.S. now provides about $60 billion of development finance each year to low- and middle-income countries. Yet, at $80 billion a year in aid and credit commitment, China remains the single largest official source of international development finance, AidData says.For the past two decades, China has dominated global infrastructure finance with faster and bigger projects. Now it has rebooted with more stringent environmental, social and governance safeguards, said Bradley Parks, executive director of AidData.He said, ""this finding is a big deal because China's competitors in the global infrastructure market offer safety but not speed.""""Beijing, on the other hand, is squaring the circle between safety and speed. It is several steps ahead of its competitors in the global infrastructure market. It is laser-focused on giving leaders in the developing world exactly what they want: rapid delivery of big-ticket infrastructure projects without unreasonably high levels of risk,"" he said. ""Whether the U.S. will be able to do the same is a big question mark.""","['2017', 'daily', 'the past two decades', 'Wednesday', 'just a couple of years', 'five years ago', '2021', 'each year', 'Tuesday']","['China', ""Sri Lanka's Port of Colombo"", 'Beijing', 'Hambantota', 'India', ""Sri Lanka's"", 'U.S.', 'the United States', 'Port City', 'Virginia', 'Colombo', 'Sri Lanka']","['DFC Chief Executive', 'the Sri Lanka Ports Authority', 'the Belt and Road Initiative', 'BRI', 'the Indo-Pacific region', 'China Communications Construction Company', 'Nathan', 'Adani Ports & Special Economic Zones Ltd.', 'China Merchants Port Holdings', 'William & Mary', 'Chinese Foreign Ministry', 'the U.S. International Development Finance Corp.', 'CHEC Port City Colombo Co.', 'John Keells Holdings', 'DFC']","['AidData', 'Wang Wenbin', 'Bradley Parks', 'Scott Nathan', 'Sri Lanka']",thehimalayantimes

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/putins-visit-to-beijing-underscores-chinas-economic-and-diplomatic-support-for-russia,Putin's visit to Beijing underscores China's economic and diplomatic support for Russia,2023-10-16 14:51,"Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to meet this week with Chinese leaders in Beijing on a visit that underscores China's support for Moscow during its war in Ukraine.The two countries have forged an informal alliance against the United States and other democratic nations that is now complicated by the Israel-Hamas war. China has sought to balance its ties with Israel with its economic relations with Iran and Syria, which are strongly backed by Russia.Putin's visit is also a show of support for Chinese leader Xi Jinping's signature Belt and Road initiative to build infrastructure and expand China's overseas influence.Putin gave an interview to Chinese state media praising the massive but loosely linked BRI projects.""Yes, we see that some people consider it an attempt by the People's Republic of China to put someone under its thumb, but we see otherwise, we just see desire for cooperation,"" he said in the interview with state broadcaster CCTV, according to a transcript released by the Kremlin on Monday.The Russian leader will be among the highest profile guests at a gathering marking the 10th anniversary of Xi's announcement of the BRI policy, which has laden countries such as Zambia and Sri Lanka with heavy debt after they signed contracts with Chinese companies to build roads, airports and other public works they could not otherwise afford.Putin's visit has not been officially confirmed, but Chinese officials have suggested he will arrive late Monday.Asked by reporters Friday about a visit to China, Putin said it would encompass talks on Belt and Road-related projects, which he said Moscow wants to link with efforts by an economic alliance of ex-Soviet Union nations mostly located in Central Asia to ""achieve common development goals."" He also downplayed the impact of China's economic influence in a region that Russia has long considered its backyard and where it has worked to maintain political and military clout.""We don't have any contradictions here, on the contrary, there is a certain synergy,"" Putin said.Putin said he and Xi will also discuss growing economic and financial ties between Moscow and Beijing.Beijing and Moscow have financial ties in energy, high-tech and financial industries. China has also grown in importance as an export destination for Moscow.Alexander Gabuev, director of Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said that from China's view, ""Russia is a safe neighbor that is friendly, that is a source of cheap raw materials, that's a support for Chinese initiatives on the global stage and that's also a source of military technologies, some of those that China doesn't have.""""For Russia, China is its lifeline, economic lifeline in its brutal repression against Ukraine,"" Gabuev told The Associated Press.""It's the major market for Russian commodities, it's a country that provides its currency and payment system to settle Russia's trade with the outside world - with China itself, but also with many other countries, and is also the major source of sophisticated technological imports, including dual-use goods that go into the Russian military machine.""Gabuev said that while Moscow and Beijing will be unlikely to forge a full-fledged military alliance, their defense cooperation will grow.""I don't expect that Russia and China will create a military alliance,"" Gabuev said. ""Both countries are self-sufficient in terms of security and they benefit from partnering, but neither really requires a security guarantee from the other. And they preach strategic autonomy.""""There will be no military alliance, but there will be closer military cooperation, more interoperability, more cooperation on projecting force together, including in places like the Arctic and more joint effort to develop a missile defense that makes the U.S. nuclear planning and planning of the U.S. and its allies in Asia and in Europe more complicated,"" he added.China and the former Soviet Union were Cold War rivals for influence among left-leaning states, but have since partnered in the economic, military and diplomatic spheres. Just weeks before Russia's invasion of Ukraine last February, Putin met with Xi in Beijing and the sides signed an agreement pledging a ""no-limits"" relationship. Beijing's attempts to present itself as a neutral peace broker in Russia's war on Ukraine have been widely dismissed by the international community.Xi visited Moscow in March as part of a flurry of exchanges between the countries. China has condemned international sanctions imposed on Russia, but hasn't directly addressed an arrest warrant issued for Putin by the International Criminal Court on charges of alleged involvement in the abductions of thousands of children from Ukraine.","['Just weeks', 'this week', 'Monday', 'Friday', 'last February', 'March', 'late Monday']","['Ukraine', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Moscow', 'Israel', 'Iran', 'Soviet Union', ""the People's Republic of China"", 'Syria', 'Zambia', 'U.S.', 'the United States', 'Russia', 'Sri Lanka']","['Kremlin', 'BRI', 'Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center', 'the International Criminal Court', 'The Associated Press', 'ex-Soviet Union', 'CCTV']","['Alexander Gabuev', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Putin', 'BRI', 'Xi Jinping', 'Gabuev', 'Xi']",thehimalayantimes

He highlighted the government's clear commitment to advancing development projects by selecting and implementing initiatives under the BRI.He acknowledged that questions and concerns have arisen regarding project delays, attributing these delays to factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic and infrastructure limitations. Nevertheless, he expressed Nepal's strong desire to accelerate development and prosperity through the BRI.PM Dahal also endorsed Chinese President Xi Jinping's statement that Nepal would transform from a landlocked to a land-linked country. He stressed the need for collective efforts to turn this vision into reality, particularly by discussing the financial investment model for such projects. He expressed hope that China would consider adopting a policy of grants and assistance for specific projects in Nepal.PM Dahal commended China's remarkable development as an exemplary nation and a friendly neighbor to Nepal. He reiterated Nepal's commitment to achieving rapid development, poverty alleviation, and sustainable development, all in alignment with China's principles of common prosperity.PM Dahal noted Nepal's need for significant infrastructure investments and emphasized that traditional sources alone cannot fulfill this need. He highlighted the importance of accelerating work through joint mechanisms and adherence to timetables for projects.Reiterating Nepal's commitment to the one-China principle, PM Dahal stated unequivocally that Nepali territories would not be used for anti-Chinese activities. He thanked the Government of China for its support in Nepal's economic and social development and emphasized the importance of Nepal-China relations based on the principles of the United Nations and Panchasheel for regional peace, stability, and prosperity.PM Dahal discussed his efforts to communicate these priorities to Chinese leaders, academics, and the business community. He emphasized the potential for mutually beneficial relations between the two countries and encouraged the transformation of possibilities into opportunities.Reflecting on Chinese President Xi's 2019 visit to Nepal and subsequent bilateral visits, PM Dahal affirmed Nepal's commitment to advancing BRI projects. He described the BRI as a 21st-century initiative focused on infrastructure and economic development and highlighted its impact on global trade, investment, and connectivity.The PM expressed confidence in the seminar's role in disseminating information about the multifaceted aspects of the BRI and its inclusive development principles based on win-win cooperation. He acknowledged President Xi Jinping's introduction of the BRI in 2013.PM Dahal anticipated that the program's conclusions would serve as a vital reference point for both governments and the private sector. These conclusions would guide efforts to expand trans-Himalayan multi-dimensional connectivity between Nepal and China, promote mutual prosperity, strengthen collaboration between the two nations, and address mutual concerns and interests.He further elaborated on discussions with Chinese President Xi and Premier Li Keqiang during his recent official visit to China. He believed that the various Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) and agreements, as well as the Joint Statement, would play a crucial role in strengthening economic, social, cultural, political, and people-to-people relations.PM Dahal expressed confidence that his visit would elevate Nepal-China relations to new heights. He anticipated increased collaboration between the Chinese side and Nepal's private sector, resulting in more investments.He affirmed the government's commitment to supporting such collaborations, which would benefit both countries through technology transfer and investment in areas of comparative advantage.","['today', '2019', '21st-century']","['China', 'Nepal']","['the United Nations', 'BRI', 'the Nepal-China Friendship Forum', 'the BRI.PM Dahal', 'the Government of China', 'Nepal-China', 'COVID-19', 'PM Dahal']","['BRI', 'Nepal', 'Xi Jinping', 'Li Keqiang', 'BRI.He', 'Pushpa Kamal Dahal', 'Dahal', 'Xi']",thehimalayantimes
https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/opportunity-structures-of-development-models-shift-as-world-order-changes,Opportunity structures of development models shift as world order changes,2023-09-28 11:50,"How has the war in Ukraine impacted Germany and Europe? What are the implications of Germany's Zeitenwende?Zeitenvende means turning point in history. From a German perspective, it truly is a turning point in history. It is the end of 30 years period of peace and prosperity achieved after the end of the Cold War. Germany was reunified in 1990 as one of the main outcomes of the end of the Cold War and this was also a period starting with the charter of Paris where we constructed the European security order which was based on the promise that territorial integrity and sovereignty or borders could not be changed unilaterally and definitely not by military force.This security order has ended with the Russian invasion. This war would go on for some time. This war has caused sufferings and destruction within Ukraine and has also sent economic and technical shock waves around the world. We have seen energy shock, rising inflation, food shortages, and grain shortages around the world.In the medium and long term, we are going to see the rebuilding of European territorial defence capabilities, especially in Germany, because we have to deal with the possibility of a land war.What are the global implications of war in Ukraine, particularly across Asia, and how should the world deal with them?There is a prospect of intensifying competition between the US and China so the geopolitical logic here is that for many in the US stopping Russia is about sending a signal to China that there is a high cost of invasion and at the same time it does push Russia into China's arms so the war has immediate political implications on the global level. I would say the US and China look at Ukraine but think about Taiwan.How will Asian countries deal with the two big rivals - US and China - in the coming decades?I think the strategic competition over hegemony between the US and China is going to stay with us for at least one generation. The real question is: will this go into a hot war scenario or cold war scenario or can it be managed? And this is what everyone in Asia is really concerned about. The hot war scenario most likely will play out around the straits of Taiwan. Why? If we look at situation from the perspective of Beijing, China does feel encircled by the US and its allies especially because of the capability of the US and its allies to blockade and cut off China supply lines and export routes. For the last 15 years, China has been trying to break out of this encirclement. Westward is the belt and road initiative with very important lanes in Pakistan and Myanmar which allow China to bypass the Strait of Malacca. But also, in your neighbourhood there are risks of clashes with India both in the Himalayas as well as Sikkim. Eastward, China tries to push out rival powers out of the South China Sea by militarising the area. Therefore, China is in conflict with the Asian maritime states and trying to push into the strategic depth of the west pacific. This is where Japan's Senkaku island, the Philippines and Taiwan figure. If you look from the perspective of Washington, this is the first aggressive military peer power that is actually pushing towards Guam, Hawaii and the American West coast so there is a pearl harbour trauma. I think for the US, Taiwan is the line in the sand. This is very dangerous as it could escalate into a hot war between the two nuclear armed super powers and it could draw other powers into the conflict.But let's assume cooler minds prevail and we can somehow either turn this into a cold war competition or somehow manage this conflict. I therefore think the theatre in which this cold war competition is going to be played out will be the economy and technology.This will have long-lasting implications for all the other Asian states. If you think about the development model of many East Asian countries for the last 30 to 40 years, it was basically a triangle between cheap labour, catch-up industrialisation and export-led growth. The problem now with this geoeconomic competition is that all of these three parts of the triangle are under pressure.The replacement of humans with machine allows industrialised countries to insource some of the products closer to home out of the danger zone. Export-led business is a problem because there is a lot of protectionist pressure which means that if you are my friend you can go into my market but if you are not, I will block you out. Catch-up industrialisation can only work if there is technology transfer and if counties are integrated in the global supply chain. I think if I were, Nepal, or Myanmar or Mongolia or Indonesia, I would worry how this geoeconomic reorganisation of Asian economies would impact my development model.How can smaller countries like Nepal that want to remain neutral best protect their interests?There is enormous pressure to take sides. This pressure is very difficult to resist because of interdependence.If you look at for instance the chip war, countries are under pressure to decouple when it comes to high-tech semiconductors. When we look at countries that need a bailout in a sovereign debt crisis, we confront the question who is going to deliver this bailout.Whether it will be the western dominated IMF or a Chinese dominated institution?There are a lot of pressure points that are making it difficult for countries to remain neutral. At the same time, I can tell you with the very few exceptions, most Asian countries do not want to choose sides because they see that technological bifurcation, binaries in terms of ideologies, democracy versus autocracy and bipolar block building when it comes to trade and economics will, in the long run, impact their development opportunities negatively so they would like to stay out of it when it comes to hot war scenario as well as cold war scenario. Is this possible? Most countries are balancing and most countries are hedging and trying to somehow remain there. Different countries have different pressure points and this is what needs to be watched.What role can Western democracies play in upholding the rules-based international order? And what lessons can we learn from the current crisis?There is by and large, consensus on keeping the rule-based international order working that would benefit everyone. The questions I am being asked in the global south is whose rules because many rising powers of the global south are saying that they no longer accept the rulesbased order in the set-up of 1945.They say the rules-based order has to be adapted to the global balance of power in the 21st century. We can build on a very broad consensus to keep the rules of the road because they are beneficial, but there needs to be a move to adapt the international rule-based order to balance power in the 21st century.How does FES look into the new geopolitics in the region and its implications for the broader democratisation process?Well, FES is a bridge builder. This is how we understand and want to play our roles accordingly. After 50 years of being in a strong and deep partnership with countries in the region, we are trying to bring to the table a better understanding of what the countries in the region want and how we can translate that into political conversations in Berlin and Brussels. We identify gaps and build bridges. You will see that within the geopolitical competition, the ability of western democracies to pressurise anti-democratic regimes will be not as strong as it was and countries have the ability to evade pressure by going to the other side.It would be better to talk about the rules-based order instead of this binary rivalry between democracy and autocracies.Since you have been writing and speaking on Transformative Realism – how relevant will that approach be when societies are trying to write their own script?Well, I think this is very important when we talk about the connection between the external opportunity structure and the inner ability to adapt. Every country needs to think about how it manoeuvres, how it adapts its development model. Every country in the world is always shifting development path. If too many powerful actors come to the conclusion that this kind of shift is not in their benefit, they will resist and uphold the status quo. Transformative change making and transformative realism is looking inside the country and asking how do you actually organise politically such a momentous shift? My answer is that we have to look not only at the majority in the parliament - that is superficial - but the entire society. How do we organise alliances for change? If you do not look into the implications for society at large, you will end up in transactional games or zero-sum games and it will be more or less stagnant but that is a great danger if we have been looking at what we call the geoeconomic tsunami that is rolling and going to hit the countries in the region.What are the chances of autocratic regimes coming together against USA and western democracies?As far as the US and China are concerned, they would benefit from the bipolar world because that would automatically make them the leaders and the rule setters and benefactors of their part of the world. But for everyone else, we would be worse off. There is high opportunity cost to be paid if one becomes only part of one block. You will lose market and opportunity and you will have security threats etc. on the border and no one wants that.The real question is can the rest of us resist the structural change towards bipolarity? And that goes also for the countries that you have mentioned. It is very obvious that there is a lot of friction within BRICS. Would India ever accept Chinese dominance in BRICS? The answer is no and the same question can be asked of Russia. For a great power like Russia, in the short run, it may not have any other option but accept to be a junior partner of China, but in the long run, it cannot be in Russia's interest.Ukraine invasion is a case in point. Right now, Russia is on the back foot and it basically has to swallow the pill. But we just establish that history never ends. There will be a different situation in 10 or 20 years.The idea that there will be a homogeneous anti-western group that will love each other and will act as natural partners, will not happen.The same rule also applies to the West. In the West, there is a lot of illusion that India being a democratic country will join the west. India will do no such thing. It is much more complicated than that.Countries would like multi-alignment so that they can maximise benefits. But the real questions are can that be sustainable? My view is that the real thing that forces us to choose side is technology. There is strong tendency to decouple the technology world. In the next 5 or 10 or 15 years, we can see technology compatible only in the China-led world or America-led world and that would increase the cost for the rest of the world. So, remaining neutral will come with a price.A version of this article appears in the print on September 28, 2023, of The Himalayan Times","['the last 15 years', 'September 28, 2023', 'the next 5 or 10 or 15 years', 'the end of 30 years', 'the last 30 to 40 years', 'the 21st century', '50 years', '10 or 20 years', '1990']","['Senkaku', 'Brussels', 'Indonesia', 'Russia', 'Philippines', 'BRICS', 'Germany', 'Taiwan', 'Japan', 'Mongolia', 'Ukraine', 'Beijing', 'India', 'Nepal', 'Myanmar', 'Hawaii', 'Zeitenwende?Zeitenvende', 'Paris', 'USA', 'America', 'China', 'US', 'democracies?As', 'Guam', 'Washington', 'Berlin', 'Pakistan']","['IMF', 'Transformative Realism', 'BRICS', 'The Himalayan Times', 'FES']","['Westward', 'Nepal', 'Sikkim']",thehimalayantimes

He mentioned that the Federal Education Bill has already been presented in the Federal Parliament, and the government is in the process of introducing the Federal Civil Service Bill and a bill related to the police.DPM and Acting PM Khadka asserted that the government's efforts towards good governance and development are tangible, and they will soon announce a special program aimed at promoting good governance.Regarding Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal's ongoing visit to China, he noted that the Prime Minister had agreed to implement the Belt and Road Initiative in accordance with the consensus within the ruling alliance. He emphasized that the agreements and understandings that Nepal has signed with China are in the best interests of the nation.Furthermore, Khadka mentioned that the government has initiated amendments to certain Nepal Acts to overcome legal obstacles in development endeavors, particularly in addressing land acquisition issues.He stated, ""Land acquisition is one of the major challenges hindering development efforts, and we have undertaken amendments to some Nepal Acts to address this problem.""As the Minister for Defence, Khadka underscored the importance of support and cooperation from all sectors to implement the Surkhet Airport upgrade project.He also pointed out that while the current airport can be extended by 400 meters, this may not suffice to meet future demands, necessitating the construction of another airport at Ramghat for future purposes.",['today'],"['China', 'Nepal', 'Birendranagar']","['the Belt and Road Initiative', 'the Federal Parliament', 'the Federal Civil Service Bill']","['Khadka', 'Surkhet', 'Nepal', 'Purna Bahadur Khadka', ""Pushpa Kamal Dahal's""]",thehimalayantimes
https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-nepal-china-deals,EDITORIAL: Nepal-China deals,2023-09-27 11:30,"Other agreements apart, the MoU to develop Nepal-China power grid in-terconnection can be said to be a major development, which will open the door for exporting Nepal's electricity even to our northern neighbour.From now onwards, both the countries will work out a plan of action to construct a 220kV trans-mission line from Chilime to Keyrong, China. Although Nepal and China had already initiated feasibility study on this project five years ago, no progress has been made due to uncertainty in the investment modality. Many hydropower projects in Nepal initiated by various Chinese firms could not kick-start due to lack of market guarantee. Once the proposed transmission line comes into operation, Nepal will no longer need to depend solely on India for the export of its surplus energy produced here. Construction of the north-south transmission line should encourage Chinese companies to invest in Nepal's energy sector.Nepal's former ambassadors to China said no notable agreement was reached under China's Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI), of which Nepal became a member in 2017. Nepal has been expecting grants to develop infrastructures under the BRI, whereas China's policy is to provide loans as to other countries such as Laos and Indonesia, where railways have been built under the BRI. Over the decades, Nepal and China have reached more than three dozen agreements, but none of them have been implemented, mainly due to Nepal's laxity in following them up.The trade and transit treaty, for example, was reached in March 2016 when then prime minister KP Oli had paid a visit to China. Under this treaty, Nepal was supposed get access to four seaports and three dry ports for import and export of goods to and from third countries as well. But this agreement has not come into operation as Nepal has not taken any proactive role to make it functional. Looking at the MoUs, we can say that PM Dahal embarked on a visit to China without doing any proper homework.Market monitoringThe biggest festival of the Nepalis is just round the corner, and it is the time when traders try to make quick money by selling substandard goods or at high prices. Year in year out, traders resort to creating artificial shortages of essential foodstuffs like sugar, cooking oil, rice, wheat flour just before the festivals, and jack up prices for no rhyme or reason. Take sugar, for example, which saw prices rise by Rs 20 a kilo last week. The price of rice in the market rose by Rs 300 for a 25-kilo bag after India imposed a ban on export of non-Basmati rice recently, although Nepal imports only about half a million tons of rice, that too much of it Basmati rice.There is thus a need for monitoring the market regularly by government agencies so that consumers are not cheated. Since September 13, the monitoring team of the Department of Commerce, Supplies and Consumer Protection has taken action against 180 firms and fined them anywhere between Rs 5000 and Rs 20,000. But will such action against a few hundred firms deter the businessmen from taking undue advantage of the consumers? The consumer forums too must be active and not leave the monitoring job to the government agencies alone.A version of this article appears in the print on September 27, 2023, of The Himalayan Times","['2017', 'Year', 'year', 'September 27, 2023', 'last week', 'five years ago', 'September 13', 'the decades', 'March 2016']","['China', 'Nepal', 'India', 'Chilime', 'Indonesia', 'Laos', 'Keyrong']","['BRI', 'Basmati', 'the Department of Commerce', 'The Himalayan Times', 'MoUs']","['Nepalis', 'BRI', 'Nepal', 'KP Oli', 'Dahal']",thehimalayantimes

Both leaders agreed that all the regional powers needed to collaborate to maintain regional stability and peace and to promote prosperity. Both leaders also agreed to intensify mutual collaboration by taking into account their concerns and sensitivities, according to the release.The Chinese president told the Nepali side that China was ready to help Nepal's economic and social development with open heart.President Xi said that China and Nepal had shaped their ties on the basis of the five principles of coexistence and that bilateral ties would be strengthened further in the coming days.PM Dahal said that China and Nepal shared historical relations for a long time and in the current context the new ideas advanced by Xi would be important for peace and prosperity in this region. He did not elaborate.Xi has recently focused on belt and road initiative.Stating that Nepal pursued an independent and nonaligned policy, Dahal said that Nepal would not be part of any military alliance on any pretext.Dahal said that Nepal had agreed to China's BRI policy as it deemed that the policy could aid Nepal's development efforts.Xi remembered that after becoming the President of China he had received Dahal as the first South Asian leader.The Chinese President said that such interaction between the two countries would further cement mutual relations and confidence.PM Dahal and ChinesePresident Xi held both delegation level and one-on-one meetings. Their discussion lasted for one hour.PM Dahal is scheduled to attend the opening ceremony of the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou. The PM will leave for Beijing tomorrow and hold bilateral talks with his Chinese counterpart Premier Li Qiang on Monday.In Beijing, PM Dahal is also scheduled to meet Chairperson of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China Zhao Leji.The PM will also address an event at the Nepali Embassy in Beijing jointly organised by the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI) and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/bri-nepal-bridging-hearts-and-minds-by-linking-mountains-and-rivers,BRI Nepal: Bridging hearts and minds by linking mountains and rivers,2023-09-06 11:45,"As stated by scholar Anand Aditya, BRI is a transregional agenda where the superstates (China, Russia, India and USA) are in a deep process of stakebuilding. As an update of the historical Silk Road, which for centuries facilitated interaction among the Eurasian people from 2nd century BC tomid-15thcentury, the modern version symbolises China's collaboration with the international community for 'shared interest' and 'shared growth'.If Nepal's location was of historical significance in the past, it remains geopolitically no less relevant to-day. Nepal lay en route from Lhasa to Kathmandu to Pataliputra between the Silk Road's 'Imperial Highway' in the Shanghai-Kabul-Persia belt in the north, and the Great Royal Road in the Bengal-Delhi-Taxila corridor in the south. Nepal can, therefore, benefit from the BRI to access the markets from East-/Central Asia to Europe, and serve as a land-bridge between China and India. In other words, BRI-Nepal programmes would ensure not only geostrategic security for each partner, but also develop activities through integration of the mountain areas, management of natural resources, commerce, poverty alleviation and human development.The implementation of the project, however, leaves much to be desired; the culprit here is the yawning gap between the agreement and its delivery rates. Using the five article framework of the BRI Framework Agreement, signed on May 12, 2017, Nepal had proposed to China a rather long list of 35 projects, and on China's suggestions limited the list to a 'single digit', or nine projects. But public scrutiny and institutional vetting on the appropriateness of this project-basketin terms of Nepal's economy, sustainable development goals, financing and implementation are still waiting.Nepal direly needs huge capital outlays for national development, especially for the Himalayan region, within a short period, but such outlays have to be of a short gestation-period, which support livelihood strategy, poverty alleviationand trans-border sharing of benefits. Nepal and China can, therefore, accord priority to the development of local areas along their border to include road networks, customs offices, common market and currency exchange facility.Secondly, the Koshi, Karnali and Far-Western provinces are in need of transport and communication facility in their north-south corridors, which would help these provinces to link up with the Indian Railway in the south, and access Chinese HighwayG318 and G219 in the Shanghai-Lha-sa-Kashgar belt in the north! Third, the Kathmandu to Nyalum-/ Kyirong international 'friendship' highways suffer from serious capacity-underuse due to low level of trade flow, weak passenger-transit system, fragile customs services, as also poorly planned marketing. Improvement on these facilities can address Nepal's huge trade deficit with China, as wellas the zero-level trade with Central Asia and beyond.Fourth, the hype about Kyirong (China)-Kathmandu Railway has to be correlated with the Raxaul (India)-Kathmandu Railway's schedule, beefing up trans-shipment capability, terms of financing and economic returns.Finally, the proposal for enhancing the role of electricity in consolidating Nepal-China relations remains an issue almost ignored so far. Instead of setting up discrete projects on an ad hoc basis, they should be made an integralpart of the market model, i.e., supplier, buyer and prices. This we say because Nepal is now nearly self-sufficient in electricity, and access to the export markets of electricity in the south is in a monopsonic situation. Therefore Nepal can profitably export electricity via Tibet to mainland China, which Nepal can operationalise by harnessing transboundary rivers like the Arun, Tamakoshi, Trishuli, Budhigandaki and Karnali.This discussion on common modern linkages for BRI in Nepal's high mountain and river systems concludes with four recommendations.First, Nepal and China may emphasise local development through local governments (like the district/ municipality in Nepal, and prefecture/ county in Tibet) on local road networks and common markets in their contiguous trans-border areas.Second, the strategic northsouth highway in the Chentang-Kimathanka-Khandbari corridor in Koshi Province, and the Burang-Yari-Simikot corridor in Karnali Province should be of the first-order priorities to develop the nation in a balanced way, and to complement the transregional agenda of superstates.Third, the Kyirong-Kathmandu Railway is contingent upon several factors like the efficient use of Sino-Nepal highways and Nepal's international airports, affordability, rate of return and tripartite utility (China-Nepal-India) as a long-term agenda. Fourth, Nepal-China collaboration on hydro-electricity generation in Nepal, and export to mainland China are critical for economic growth and climate change adaptations for each partner.But the above BRI Nepal programme also demands a modest size of finance.Apart from the eight financing institutions China has set for financing the BRI, Nepal may also approach the World Bank and IMF. Since these projects can yield good economic internal rates of returns, we can combine grant and commercial loan from the Chinese, Indian and Western agencies. The BRI proposals on Nepal discussed are consistent not only with the superstates' transregional agenda, focused on the needs of the three nations, but also consistent with the country's SDG targets and geosecurity concerns.A version of this article appears in the print on September 06, 2023, of The Himalayan Times.","['May 12, 2017', 'September 06, 2023', 'centuries', '2nd century']","['China', 'Persia', 'Kathmandu', 'Trishuli', 'India', 'Nepal', 'Karnali Province', 'Koshi Province', 'Lhasa', 'Russia', 'Kabul', 'Budhigandaki', 'Tamakoshi', 'USA', 'Shanghai', 'Tibet']","['Koshi', 'the BRI Framework Agreement', ""the Silk Road's '"", 'BRI', 'Nepal-China', 'BRI-Nepal', 'the Great Royal Road', 'the Kyirong-Kathmandu Railway', 'Karnali', 'Nyalum-/ Kyirong', 'Railway', 'SDG', 'the World Bank', 'Karnali and Far-Western', 'The Himalayan Times', 'BC']","['Raxaul', 'BRI', 'Nepal', 'Kyirong', 'BRI Nepal', 'Anand Aditya']",thehimalayantimes

These projects were signed during the visit of China's then Foreign Minister Wang Yi to Nepal in March 2022.""Nepal's diplomatic efforts are directed towards building independent opinion on international issues on the basis of merits and demerits, voting and making the international ties just, fair, responsible and cooperative,"" FM Saud added.During the deliberation on budget and programme allocated for the Foreign Ministry and subordinate bodies under the Appropriation Bill, 2060, former Foreign Minister Bimala Paudyal Rai enquired whether Nepal is deviated from the non-aligned foreign policy.Stating that Nepal has been strengthening and expanding relations with other countries including neighjbouring countries on the basis of universal equality, mutual respect and benefit, Minister Saud mentioned that Nepal has been able to achieve credibility and respect in the world due to the independent, balanced, impartial and objective point of view it has adopted.Foreign Minister Saud had participated in the Summit of Non-Aligned Movement held at Baku of Azerbaijan from July 3-6. The Foreign Minister briefed the upper house of the Federal Parliament about his address in the Summit.""I had expressed commitment of the Government of Nepal on collaboration for further highlighting the relevance and significance of the Non-Aligned Movement in the changing international scenario as well as laid emphasis on solidarity and collaboration of Non-Aligned Movement member countries for the resolution of burning political and economic issues of the world.

Putin has frequently lashed out at the West for its support of Ukraine in the war.The summit presented an opportunity for Putin to show he remains in control after the insurrection left some wondering about divisions among Russian elites.""The Russian people are united as never before,"" he said. ""The solidarity and responsibility for the fate of the fatherland was clearly demonstrated by the Russian political circles and the entire society by standing as a united front against the attempted armed rebellion.""Earlier speakers avoided direct references to the war, while bemoaning its global consequences.A declaration adopted at the virtual summit also made no reference to Ukraine, but it said threats and challenges are ``becoming more and more complex, destructive and dangerous, existing conflicts are aggravating and new conflicts are emerging.""In his opening speech, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned of global challenges to food, fuel and fertilizer supplies but didn't mention the war in Ukraine. Trade in all three has been disrupted by the war.He also took a veiled swipe at Pakistan, saying the group shouldn't hesitate to criticize countries that are ""using terrorism as an instrument of its state policy.""""Terrorism poses a threat to regional peace and we need to take up a joint fight,"" Modi said without naming Pakistan. India regularly accuses Pakistan of training and arming insurgent groups, a charge that Islamabad denies.In his speech, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif denounced terrorism and defended his country's role in the fight against it.""While the sacrifices made by Pakistan in fighting terrorism are without parallel, this scourge continues to plague our region and remains a serious obstacle to the maintenance of peace and stability,"" Sharif said. ""Any temptation to use it as a cudgel for diplomatic point scoring must be eschewed.""Sharif also hailed the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, saying it could be a ""game changer for connectivity, stability, peace and prosperity in the region.""Six of the nine SCO members - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan - reaffirmed their support for the BRI initiative, the declaration said.India opposes the initiative because it is being built through a portion of Kashmir under the control of Pakistan that New Delhi considers to be included in its part of the divided territory.The declaration calls for new approaches to promote more equitable and effective international cooperation. It also said the SCO is not directed against any other states and is open to broad cooperation with all.It said the ``principles of mutual respect for sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity of states, non-interference in internal affairs and non-use of force or threats to use force, are the basis of sustainable development of international relations.""The SCO includes the four Central Asian nations of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, all former Soviet republics in which Russian influence runs deep. India and Pakistan became members in 2017. Belarus is also in line for membership.Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said that ""the benefits of the official membership of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the SCO will be historic.""Raisi's speech, cited by the Iranian news agency IRNA, expressed the hope that membership will prepare the ground for improving collective security, respect for the sovereignty of member nations, sustainable development, and confronting environmental threats.UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in a message that the summit was taking place amid growing global challenges and risks.""But at a time when the world needs to work together, divisions are growing, and geopolitical tensions are rising,"" he said.""These differences have been aggravated by several factors: diverging approaches to global crises; contrasting views on nontraditional security threats; and, of course, the consequences of COVID-19 and Russia's invasion of Ukraine,"" he said.Chinese President Xi Jinping called on members to work toward ""long-term peace and stability in the region,"" according to a readout of his speech posted by state broadcaster CCTV.He said China wants to ""better synergize"" the country's Belt and Road Initiative - a trillion-dollar infrastructure investment project criticized in the West for burdening smaller countries with large amounts of debt - with other nations' own development strategies and regional cooperation initiatives.Even as the SCO continues to expand, the group remains at risk of competing interests or conflicts between member states.India and Pakistan share a history of bitter relations, mainly over Kashmir, a disputed Himalayan region that is split between them but claimed by both in its entirety, and they have fought two wars over it.Meanwhile, New Delhi and Beijing are locked in a three-year standoff of thousands of soldiers stationed along their disputed border in the eastern Ladakh region.And the SCO summit took place as Moscow relies more deeply on Beijing as its war in Ukraine drags on.

He said they agreed to resolve all their outstanding issues, including a border dispute.Dahal said at a joint news conference that they reviewed ongoing projects and discussed ways to further cooperate in connectivity, energy and people-to-people contact.New Nepalese prime ministers traditionally visit neighboring India soon after taking office.Nepal is bordered on three sides by India, with an open frontier allowing traffic without passports or visas.Until recently, India was a dominant force in Nepal, but China's involvement has grown in the last few years. China has invested in the building of airports, highways and hydropower projects.

A coalition government headed by a communist prime minister has again taken power after an election in late 2022.Relations with India soured in 2015, when it supported protests by ethnic groups in southern Nepal against a new constitution and imposed an unofficial economic blockade, shutting down the supply of oil and goods over the border.The previous communist government issued a new map of the country in 2020 that includes an area claimed by both India and Nepal, further angering New Delhi.This is Dahal's third time in office since his Maoist group abandoned a decade-long armed revolt and joined a UN-assisted peace process and entered mainstream politics in 2006. The conflict killed more than 17,000 people.","['2017', '2006', 'the last few years', 'decade', '2015', 'four-day', 'last December', 'Thursday', '2020']","['China', 'Beijing', 'New Delhi', 'India', 'Nepal']","['UN', 'The Associated Press', 'Belt and Road Initiative']","['Landlocked Nepal', 'Narendra Modi', 'Nepal', 'Dahal', 'Narayan Prakash', 'Himalayan', 'Kamal Dahal']",thehimalayantimes

In the early 1970s, Glantz shifted his research from wars of national liberation to understanding climate's impact on society and society's impacts on Climate. He was NCAR's only Senior Social Scientist in its 60-year history.In 2008 he moved to the University of Colorado as director of the Consortium for Capacity Building. He has written or edited a total of 30+ books, and many are articles on linkages between climate, water, weather, and society.In 2019 he published 'One Belt One Road: China's Long March Toward 2049.' Bal Krishna Sah of The Himalayan Times talked to him about geopolitics and climate challenge. Excerpts:Is the Belt and Road Initiative a challenge to the US or a positive initiative by China for the entire world?It can be both. It can be a challenge to the US, Europe, Russia, and India. It's a challenge to everybody. When president Xi Jinping announced the BRI or firstly One Belt One Road (OBOR) in 2013. It was really a good initiative. They made trillions of dollars earlier, before COV- ID. And they decided to put the money into trade not aid. More trade and development, some grants, some loans. The loans became problematic.They were reaching out to other countries and letting companies make all the arrangements such as low interests loans, but the Chinese companies were investing in projects that may not be sustainable, or projects that did not meet the conditions of Western banks.So, it was easier to go to China and say oh! I am going to get some needed infrastructure, which the West should have been giving but didn't. Problem arises when you default on your loan. The first visible case was Sri Lanka. They took the port on lease for 99 years and that gave the West the opportunity to say 'China is creating debt'. It's debt diplomacy. So, China beat the West. The West does not have the money to counter China's initiative because they give aid and distribute their money in different ways and their banks operate differently.COVID gave a chance to countries to rethink whether they should take loan. So, COVID turned out to be a positive break for both OBOR recipients and China.The Chinese tend not to forgive loans, but Western banks often forgive loans. They were sleeping while China got the story and head line and that was clever.How can Nepal turn its geopolitical challenges into opportunity?There is the expression that Nepal is between a rock and a hard place geopolitically. You know, everyone has problems with one another. Like the West has with India, India has a problem with the west. The West has a problem with India not doing certain things regarding Ukraine. So, it's all into an oven.The best that Nepal can do is somehow not play them against each other but to remain neutral even though it will be perceived as not neutral. If it is nicer to China, India gets mad. If it is nicer to India, China gets mad. So, Nepal has to figure out how to play them because Nepal is not strong enough to beat either one. So, it's all about how to use geography to its advantage. Nepal has to be very cleverly diplomatic. Nepali leaders have to sleep with one eye open. I mean they have to worry about India or china.China has two things. China has Tibet to protect. It's not just China. And, there is another side too. There is another province with other countries. So, China wants a buffer, but it does not want Nepal to be so pro-India like it's India on the edge. There is no miracle cure. It just happened to be born in a difficult spot.How can a generational war between old elites and the young generation be stopped?Who influences the young generation? In the US, where parents are democrats, kids are most likely to be democrats. So, it's ideology before a kid even has any idea what the word means. So, I think it's human nature, you get different opinions on how to run a railroad, how to run a city, how to run a government and they compete for attention. There is no perfect government. Even Switzerland has problems with the banks and everything.So, I don't know what you can do about human nature. I think youth have to be involved in early careers as young professionals. They need to be included in the discussions. They must have a seat at the table. But not every youth is a youth you want at the table. You know, they have to understand.For example, Trump, who we elected was very popular with a subset of people, but he was a terrible president. Everything he did was ineffective. But for some reasons he became like a cult leader and tried to destroy the constitution. So, basically he is running for president to destroy the constitution, which allows him to be the president. Many congress men are like that, authoritarian. So it's very tough.How do you think Nepal can maintain political stability?We can look at a country like Ecuador, which has had four presidents in one year. They dropped the currency there because it was fluctuating crazily. They then went to the US Dollar. El Salvador, the same, they hoped and went for the crypto (Bitcoin) for currency. How did they do that? I think there are other countries that have gone through similar situations with rapid turnover of the government. It's instability. The problem is, at some point, people will go for what they think will give them stability and that's more authoritarian. That's the tendency that some voices rise from the mass saying they are fighting. Then somebody says oh! Let's take control in our old hands. That's what they did in Hungary, which was trying to go democratic. They picked a guy who immediately started the change. The legislature and control of stuff like that is a real tool. There are examples, and maybe you could explore.","['the early 1970s', '2049', '60-year', '2019', '2013', 'one year', '99 years', '2008']","['Ukraine', 'China', 'US', 'India', 'Nepal', 'Hungary', 'Switzerland', 'Russia', 'china', 'Tibet', 'El Salvador', 'Ecuador', 'Sri Lanka']","['congress', 'Climate', 'Trump', 'the University of Colorado', 'the Belt and Road Initiative', 'BRI', 'Belt One Road', 'the US Dollar', 'COVID', 'the Consortium for Capacity Building', 'Social Scientist', 'The Himalayan Times']","['NCAR', 'Nepal', 'Xi Jinping', 'Bal Krishna Sah', 'Michael H Glantz', 'Glantz']",thehimalayantimes

The two Asian giants compete for influence over the tiny nation, showering it with financial aid and investments.Saud, however, said the government would continue to maintain good relationship with both countries and would not do anything to hamper ties with either of the neighbors.""We will never use the two nations against each other for our own benefit. We will not interfere with their internal matters of their countries, and we would also want that no other country should interfere with out internal issues,"" Saud said.Until recently, India had been a dominant force in Nepal but China's involvement has begun to grow.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/i-just-want-my-legs-back-myanmar-landmine-casualties-soar,'I just want my legs back': Myanmar landmine casualties soar,2023-02-19 19:15,"The 3-year-old boy had taken only two steps from his mother's lap when a deafening explosion rang out. The blast caught the woman in the face, blurring her vision. She forced her eyes open and searched for her son around the jetty where they'd been waiting for a ferry, near their small village in south-central Myanmar.Through the smoke, she spotted him. His body lay on the ground, his feet and legs mangled with flesh peeled away, shattered bones exposed.""He was crying and telling me that it hurt so much,"" she said. ""He didn't know what just happened.""But she did.The boy had detonated a landmine, an explosive device designed to mutilate or destroy whatever comes into its path.Landmines have been banned for decades by most countries, since the UN Mine Ban Treaty was adopted in 1997. But in Myanmar, which isn't party to the treaty, the use of mines has soared since the military seized power from the democratically elected government in February 2021 and armed resistance has skyrocketed.Landmines are planted by all sides of the conflict in Myanmar, and they're responsible for surging civilian casualties, including an alarming number of children as victims, according to an AP analysis based on data and reports from nonprofit and humanitarian organizations, interviews with civilian victims, families, local aid workers, military defectors and monitoring groups.In 2022, UN figures show, civilian casualties from landmine and unexploded ordnance spiked by nearly 40%. Experts say this and other official tallies are vastly undercounted, largely due to difficulties monitoring and reporting during the conflict.Despite incomplete numbers, experts agree the increase in Myanmar is the largest ever recorded.Virtually no area is immune to the threat. Over the past two years, mine contamination has spread to every state and region except for the capital city, Naypyitaw, according to Landmine Monitor, a group that tracks global landmine use.The military also uses civilians as human shields, a practice widespread in the country for decades but raising alarms with increasing mine incidents. AP's analysis found the military, known as the Tatmadaw, forced people to walk ahead of troops to detonate potential landmines in their path, protecting their own troops.The Myanmar military, which has acknowledged mine use in the past, didn't respond to a list of questions AP sent to their official spokesperson's email.When the fighting moves on, landmines don't. Mines left behind can indiscriminately maim or kill those who happen upon them, years later.It raises the specter of casualties for years to come. In countries including Egypt and Cambodia, people continue to die from millions of mines left behind long after conflicts has ended.""Leaving an activated mine like this is the same as releasing a monster,"" said a 26-year-old military defector who worked as a combat engineer platoon commander in Myanmar.Like most who were interviewed by AP, the defector spoke on condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family from military retaliation.Landmines and unexploded ordnance have been a persistent issue in Myanmar for more than four decades. The problem has grown exponentially since the military takeover, with heavier use of landmines in more parts of the country, said Kim Warren, a U.N. landmine specialist.In 2022, 390 people were victims of landmines and unexploded ordnance in Myanmar, more than a 37% increase from 2021, according to figures compiled by UNICEF. Overall, 102 people were killed and 288 were wounded, with children making up some 34% of the victims, compared with 26% in 2021.Still, Warren said, incidents are underreported.Yeshua Moser-Puangsuwan, Landmine Monitor's Myanmar expert, said his group counts only casualties it can confirm with confidence: ""We've always been undercounting.""Experts concede the total number of casualties may seem small, with Myanmar's population of about 56 million, but say the rapid increase is distressing nonetheless. Experts are particularly concerned about children victims. Many are unaware of how lethal landmines and unexploded munitions are; some pick them up and play with them.Many civilian victims encounter landmines during daily routines.In March 2021, two teenage cousins were working on a small family-run plot in Shan state. They'd just left to dig for sweet potatoes when the father of one of the boys heard a blast. He rushed to help but was too late. They'd been killed instantly. They'd triggered a mine.The father, 47, tears up when he returns to the fields.""But it's my family's business, so I have to come to the farm to make a living,"" said the man, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect himself and his relatives.Many victims and families won't know who was responsible for the blasts - the Tatmadaw or anti-military groups.A member of a militia that operates in Sagaing said his group has removed nearly 100 mines thought to be planted by the military and plans to reuse them to augment its arsenal of homemade devices.""A mine is an indispensable weapon to attack the enemy,"" said the member, who spoke by phone on condition of anonymity over the sensitive information and fear the military would retaliate against his family.One man in Myanmar's western Chin state described how soldiers took him, his pregnant wife and their 5-year-old daughter captive, making them and 10 other civilians walk ahead, beating them with rifles if they refused.""I thought: 'Today is the day I die,'"" said the man, who also spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. They escaped - no mines detonated during their march.Landmine Monitor documented similar incidents in other states, calling it a ""grave violation of international humanitarian and human rights law.""Myanmar and Russia were the only states documented to have used mines in 2022, according to Landmine Monitor.The group also confirmed the military has been increasingly mining infrastructure such as mobile phone towers and power lines to deter attacks. Military-planted mines also are protecting at least two major Chinese-backed projects - a copper mine in Sagaing and a pipeline pumping station in northeastern Shan state that is part of China's Belt and Road initiative, Moser-Puangsuwan said.""We are not aware of the situation you mentioned,"" a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote to the AP in a fax. ""The cooperation project between China and Myanmar is in line with the common interests of both sides and has brought tangible benefits to the people of Myanmar.""It made no reference to any of those who'd been maimed.","['daily', '1997', '2022', '26-year-old', 'more than four decades', 'decades', '5-year-old', 'March 2021', 'the past two years', 'years later', '2021', '47', 'the day', '3-year-old', 'years', 'February 2021', 'Today']","['China', 'Cambodia', 'Myanmar', 'Egypt', 'Sagaing', 'Russia']","['AP', 'Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'Landmine Monitor', 'the UN Mine Ban Treaty', 'UN', 'Sagaing', 'U.N.', 'UNICEF', 'Moser-Puangsuwan']","['Kim Warren', 'Naypyitaw', ""Landmine Monitor's"", 'Chin', 'Tatmadaw', 'Yeshua Moser-Puangsuwan', 'Warren']",thehimalayantimes

Beijing has also made inroads lately and signed projects under its Belt and Road Initiative."" They (India and China) are big powers. Our policy of neutrality and non-alignment will be genuinely followed and implemented,"" K.P. Sharma Oli, a two-time former prime minister and president of opposition Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), or UML, told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.Oli, who is considered by some political watchers to be closer to China, gave New Delhi a rough time in his earlier term as he whipped up nationalist sentiment while altering Nepal's map over disputed land by including territories controlled by India.""We will be a reliable friend and neighbour of both. Our foreign policy will be based on mutual benefits and mutual respect,"" Oli said as he sat in his office.The 70-year-old is a favorite for prime minister if his loose alliance with royalists and a group of regional parties dominant in the southern plains wins a majority in the Nov. 20 election for the 275-member national parliament.He is facing the ruling alliance of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba with the Maoist Centre party led by Prachanda, who headed a decade long insurgency that ended in 2006. Both Deuba,76, and Prachanda,67, are vying for the top job.HIGH INFLATION, RISING INTEREST RATESThe election is taking place as Nepal faces the highest inflation in six years caused by rising energy prices after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and amid growing fears of an economic slowdown following monetary tightening.Oli said the present government had no vision to tackle inflation, high interest rates and faltering economic growth. Retail inflation is currently hovering over 8% and bank lending rates have gone up to over 18%.""The high interest rates are not helpful to businesses and industries,"" Oli said, vowing to cut rates if returned to power.In its election manifesto released on Tuesday, Oli's party promised to create 500,000 jobs every year.Oli said reconstruction of 750,000 houses, monuments, hospitals and schools destroyed by an earthquake in 2015, along with roads and airports were key achievements of his two previous governments between 2015 and 2021.""People know that UML is trustworthy, powerful and can lead a strong national government that works for them,"" he said.","['2006', 'between 2015 and', 'six years', 'decade', '2015', 'this month', 'Wednesday', 'every year', 'the Nov. 20', '70-year-old', 'Tuesday']","['Ukraine', 'China', 'Beijing', 'New Delhi', 'Kathmandhu', 'India', 'Nepal', 'Russia']","['Reuters', 'Prachanda', 'UML', 'Prachanda,67', 'the Maoist Centre', 'Communist Party of Nepal']","['Sher Bahadur Deuba', 'Deuba,76', 'Nepal', 'Oli', 'Himalayan', 'K.P.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/pm-deubas-india-visit-yet-another-feather-in-the-cap,PM Deuba's India visit: Yet another feather in the cap,2022-04-05 10:39,"His illustrious predecessors, B P Koirala, Krishan Prasad Bhattarai, Girija Prasad Koirala and Sushil Koirala had also cruised to India during their term in office in response to the tradition of visiting India soon after the assumption of office. But there is a sea difference between these visits. Whilst China was like a passive political volcano or even dormant particularly during the time of BP Koirala, it has now become more than active. Geological volcanoes are confined to the locality of their explosion, but this political volcano has sent its lava around the globe, warming up its relationship with several countries.The neighbouring areas, however, feel the heat during such an explosion, which Nepal has experienced in recent years. One recent example is the concern shown by China with regards to the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and the inclusion of Nepal in the loop of the Afghanistan, Pakistan and India visit by the Chinese Foreign Minister and State Counsellor Wang Yi just a week before the visit of Prime Minister Deuba to India. So, Deuba has to maintain equidistance and walk a tight rope during his visit without seeming to be aligned to either side.Earlier, the retention of equidistance could be expressed in words because of China's nonchalance on India-Nepali relations due to the mighty Himalayas that segregate China and Nepal in stark contrast to the porous border between India and Nepal. But now it has to be matched with deeds due to the ever increasing rivalry between India and China.The visits to India are generally fraught with political backlash. The visit of Girija Prasad Koirala invited intense criticism from the opposition party, the UML, for the initiation made on the Mahakali Treaty. This year also the UML must have wished for fumbles on the part of Deuba in order to cash in on the eve of the local election due to its likely under-performance this time. Because it is aware that the Nepali Congress folded to second position in the election that followed after it had dissolved the parliament.Furthermore, the UML had lost the election of 1999 when there was a division in the party headed by Bam Dev Gautam. This historic reality has certainly shaken the UML from inside even if it makes high decibel claims of registering a victory in the forth-coming elections.The Indian visit was going to be a double-edged sword for the Nepali Congress because the coalition partners also will hold Deuba responsible for any stumble during the visit.But they will not hesitate to share the dividend arising out of the successful trip to India. The dual character of the coalition partners has already been exposed during the MCC episode.There are several irritants in India-Nepal relations, but the border dispute between the two is the most towering one due to reportedly 71 encroachments made by India along the border. This has been aggravated after the publication of the map by Nepal incorporating the areas around Limpiyadhura. Premier Deuba raised this issue, which the Indian Ministry of External Affairs acknowledged duly, holding that it should be addressed in a responsible manner given the unparalleled relation existing between the two countries. It has in a way put an end to the conventional loud mouth of the UML.The inauguration of the Jayanagar-Kurtha railway was like a cherry on the cake of the Indian visit.Other subjects like the exchange of Memorandum of Understanding made in four areas, including the agreement reached to expedite the Pancheshwar Hydropower Project are those irritatingly familiar entities, which are regularly raised during the visit but put on the back burner immediately afterwards.The increasing trade deficit with India is another concern which did not figure in the press conference.India has been kind to Sri Lanka at the time of its economic woes. Nepal is also on the verge of facing similar problems in the wake of ascending imports and equally descending remittances, when it will certainly need Indian support.On the whole, this visit appears to be fairly successful.Much was not expected in view of the election taking place in Nepal.One can draw comfort from the fact that it went off well in a very cordial manner without the emergence of any unpleasant issues during the visit.Deuba has reaped multiple political harvests this year. He has kept the coalition intact. Besides, he has registered a landslide victory in the party. The Prime Minister was successful in laying the MCC ghost to rest. He restored political balance by agreeing to expedite the Belt and Road Initiative during the visit of the Chinese foreign minister, which otherwise had appeared to move to the Chinese orbit during the Left regime. He killed two birds with one stone by agreeing for a local tie-up in the forthcoming elections, thereby silencing the Shekhar Koirala group in the party and also the coalition partners.The Indian visit has added yet another feather in the cap of Prime Minister Deuba.He appears to be transforming into a statesman in the twilight of his political career despite several initial flaws.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-ties-consolidated,EDITORIAL - Ties consolidated,2022-03-28 11:05,"Wang's visit was, thus, a good opportunity for Nepal to clarify Nepal's position that any development assistance from a country would be utilised solely for development purposes and that it would never accept any project with political and other conditions.Nepal's firm commitment to the One China policy and not allowing any activity against China on Nepali territory is the bedrock of our relations with the northern neighbour, and Nepal's reiteration at the official talks should allay any fears it harbours.Following the bilateral talks, the two foreign ministers had witnessed the signing and exchange of nine agreements and documents. Prominent among them are the agreement on economic and technical cooperation; technical assistance scheme for China-aided feasibility study of the cross-border railway project; feasibility study of Nepal-China power grid interconnection; protocol on the safety and health condition for export of haylage from Nepal to China; and exchange of letters on duty-free treatment to be provided by China to imports of 98 per cent of goods of Nepali origin. Surprisingly, none of the agreements fall under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Although Nepal had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on bilateral cooperation under the BRI framework in 2017, no project has been identified so far under the BRI, with Nepal seeking more grants to loans while the BRI projects are funded largely through loans at high interest rates with short repayment periods. Nepal's wariness should be understood in light of the severe economic crisis that has befallen Sri Lanka after it defaulted on its debt repayments to a host of lenders, including China.It is unfortunate that Nepal has not been able to prioritise where it wants to spend the Rs 56 billion that Chinese President Xi Jinping had announced during his visit to Nepal in October 2019, of which Rs 11 billion will be provided this year under the Agreement on Economic and Technical Cooperation. Both the governments must follow up on the nine agreements that have been inked while expediting the execution of ongoing projects. It is simply inexcusable that the expansion of the 29-km Ring Road, for example, has taken nearly a decade because the Nepali side cannot give road clearance. At the same time, negotiations must continue for an agreeable mode of financing of any BRI project in the future, given Nepal's very weak exports, so as not to default on its loans.Water tap facilityEasy access to clean drinking water is still a luxury for the rural population. Clean drinking water not only helps prevent most water-borne diseases, but also helps maintain sanitation in the surrounding areas and personal hygiene. Provision of a water tap in every household in the rural areas will make life easier, especially for women who otherwise must spend hours fetching impure drinking water in water vessels far away from their homes. Much has been done in addressing this pressing problem over the past decades. But we still need to do more so that every household has drinking water facility.The pledge by the Chief Minister of Gandaki Province to provide one tap to each household is a welcome move. The province has launched the 'one house, one water tap' campaign, which can be realised provided all the stakeholders work together. The most challenging task that lies ahead is the sustainability of a drinking water project, which costs a lot of money for its construction and effective management afterward. The consumer groups in the rural areas must create a revolving fund and have skilled hands to keep the drinking water project running without financial and technical support from the government all the time.A version of this article appears in the print on March 28, 2022, of The Himalayan Times.","['2017', 'October 2019', 'nearly a decade', 'this year', 'the past decades', 'March 28, 2022']","['China', 'Nepal', 'Nepali', 'Gandaki Province', 'Sri Lanka']","['The Himalayan Times', 'BRI', 'the Belt and Road Initiative', 'Nepal', 'the Agreement on Economic and Technical Cooperation', 'Wang']","['Nepal', 'Xi Jinping', 'BRI']",thehimalayantimes

Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu is also learnt to have sent a message to Nepal's Foreign Ministry that it would be difficult to push ahead with the BRI in Nepal unless an implementation agreement plan was reached at the earliest.Should Nepal's highest leadership approve, Nepal and China will reach an agreement to implement the BRI during Wang's visit. Initially Nepal had proposed as many as 35 projects to be developed under the BRI. However, the Chinese sides asked Nepal to downsize them to a single digit, hence, Nepal has now proposed nine projects.During Wang's visit, Foreign Ministry will mainly propose carrying out a feasibility study of the trans-Himalayan Railway, opening of yet another border point (Korala in Mustang) apart from upgrading the Tatopani and Rasuwagdhi customs points, constructing the proposed 400 Kv transmission line from Galchhi to Rasuwagadhi and bringing the protocol to an Agreement on Transit Transport, reached during President Bidhya Devi Bhandari's visit to China in April 2019, into full operation. Nepal is also expected to request the Chinese side to resume flights and address the problem faced by Nepali students who returned home following the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. China is also expected to provide additional grant under technical and economic assistance. Despite the fact that Nepal and China enjoy age-old friendship without any friction, Nepal has failed to reap benefits from the economic progress China has achieved over the decades, largely because of Nepal's inability to select its development priorities and follow-ups of the agreements reached in the past. Nepal could have benefitted immensely from the Transit Transport deal, had it taken the initiative to make it fully operational. This time, Nepal should not miss the opportunity to identify its priority projects to be built under the BRI.Action neededAs a mountainous country, sustainable mountain development is Nepal's priority, but it is becoming more and more difficult to achieve it due to climate change. Already disadvantaged by the rugged terrain that makes building even the most basic infrastructure difficult, the people living in the mountains face poverty, food insecurity, environmental degradation and risks of disasters. Although their contribution to global warming is negligible, yet they continue to be unjust victims of the phenomenon.Actually, the mountains are warming twice as fast as the global average, resulting in extreme weather conditions that spawn droughts, erratic rainfall, floods, snow melt and glacier retreat.But mainstreaming mountain agenda in climate deal has a long way to go, as PM Sher Bahadur Deuba noted at the Regional Policy Dialogue on Sustainable Mountain Solutions the other day. In view of the unfolding crisis that has great impact on the future of humanity, it is necessary to promote meaningful international cooperation and not be bogged down in rhetoric. Nepal, thus, seeks the support of the international community to mitigate the challenges faced by the mountainous region before it is too late.A version of this article appears in the print on March 25, 2022, of The Himalayan Times.","['April 2019', 'Saturday', 'March 25, 2022', 'the decades', 'the other day']","['China', 'Nepal', 'Kathmandu', 'Mustang']","['Chinese Embassy', 'Foreign Ministry', 'The Himalayan Times', 'BRI', 'Agreement on Transit Transport', 'BRI.Action', 'Wang', 'Transit Transport', ""Nepal's Foreign Ministry""]","[""Bidhya Devi Bhandari's"", 'Tatopani', 'BRI', 'Nepal', 'Galchhi', 'Rasuwagdhi', 'Korala', 'Sher Bahadur Deuba', 'Narayan Khadka']",thehimalayantimes

He said China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit to India reflected a rethink of bilateral ties and the visit was aimed at improving ties between the two neighbours.Foreign policy analyst Geja Sharma Wagle said the Chinese FM's visit was aimed at moving the Belt and Road Initiative project ahead in Nepal. ""China wants to increase its influence in Nepal through BRI, but it is a loan project,"" Wagle said. He added that the government should make all documents related to BRI projects, including memorandums of understanding, public so that people could see and comment on them as they did with the Millennium Challenge Corporation compact that Nepal signed with the US.Wagle said Nepal made a mistake when it decided to elevate its relations with China from comprehensive partnership to strategic partnership without defining the term strategic partnership. A joint communique issued by Nepal and China after the Chinese president's visit in October 2019 stated that both countries had elevated their relations to strategic partnership of cooperation.Wagle said the government should have debated the term strategic partnership before agreeing to incorporate it in the joint communique. Nepal should not try to define its foreign policy vis-à-vis China on the basis of parties' political ideology.Foreign policy analyst Dinesh Bhattarai said unity was lacking on foreign policy issues. ""Are our relations with China based on political ideology?"" he wondered.Bhattarai said government leadership should learn from late PM BP Koirala's dealing with China, adding that Koirala had firmly dealt with China when a member of Nepali security agency was killed by Chinese security personnel, besides resolving the Mount Everest issue satisfactorily.About 80 participants including diplomats, bureaucrats, journalists and reporters, and scholars of various fields participated in the programme.The seminar comes just ahead of the visit of China's State Councillor and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi.In the seminar, three major topics - BRI and Geopolitics: Risks and Opportunities, Nepal-China Cross-border Relations and Nepal-China Trade, Transit, and Transport were discussed. Researchers Ajaya Bhadra Khanal, Arpan Gelal, and Shraddha Ghimire presented their research findings respectively.The first panel emphasised the impacts of great power rivalry on Nepal and viewed Chinese Foreign Minister Wang's visit from the same lens, according to a press release issued by CESIF. Furthermore, the panel discussed the contrasting models of diplomacy practised by Washington and Beijing and their averments towards one another regarding MCC and BRI.In the context of BRI, the panelist opined that the component of loan makes the BRI a complicated issue.Thus, the said issue may possibly reflect anxiety and caution in Nepal's negotiations with the Chinese side resulting in the delay in implementation of the BRI project. The panel particularly emphasised the issue of Tibet as Nepal shares border with Tibet, which is yet another contentious issue for China in its engagement with Nepal. Therefore, ""raising the issue of Tibet is more provocative than productive"".The second-panel discussion revolved around the topic of Nepal-China cross border relations.Panelists said there was lack of discussion on Nepal-China border issues, while most of the focus had been on issues along the southern border.Another major theme that emerged during the discussions was the absence of local communities in the decision-making process which also created dissonance in understanding the border between borderland communities and the capital. The disregard of northern bordering communities from state institutions have made them increasingly dependent on Chinese assistance even for their daily supplies.Panelists said there was infrastructure asymmetry between Nepal and China along the northern border which had further contributed to Nepal's growing dependency on China. They said it was important to develop strong bilateral mechanisms, including borderland communities in the decision-making process, improve coordination between the concerned ministries, and invest in the infrastructure of border management agencies.The third session of the seminar dealt with trade, transit and transportation relationship with China.The presenter highlighted the TTA agreement between the two countries signed in 2016 which gave Nepal access to seaports and three land ports via China. It has been more than five years since the agreement was signed, but it has not materialised.Furthermore, the Nepal-China border has been closed since 2020 due to COVID-19 as China imposed strict COVID-19 regulations. This has impacted Nepal's trade and economy with China. The question of China's geopolitical and strategic interest and economic benefit for Nepal through transboundary Himalayan multi-dimensional connectivity network was raised.Wagle wondered why China was imposing undeclared blockade on the northern border.A version of this article appears in the print on March 25, 2022, of The Himalayan Times.","['daily', 'October 2019', 'today', 'more than five years', 'March 25, 2022', '2016', '2020']","['BRI.In', 'China', 'Beijing', 'India', 'Nepal', 'Washington', 'Nepali', 'the United States', 'Tibet']","[""BP Koirala's"", 'CESIF', 'Geopolitics: Risks and Opportunities', 'TTA', 'BRI', 'The Himalayan Times', 'the Millennium Challenge Corporation', 'Lokraj Baral', 'Nepal-China Trade', 'Shraddha Ghimire', 'MCC', 'Nepal-China cross', 'Relations', 'the Centre for Social Inclusion and Federalism', 'Nepal-China', 'COVID-19']","['BRI', 'Dinesh Bhattarai', 'Nepal', 'Ajaya Bhadra Khanal', 'Arpan Gelal', ""Wang Yi's"", 'Bhattarai', 'Councillor', 'Wagle', 'Wang', 'Wang Yi', 'Geja Sharma Wagle']",thehimalayantimes

Foreign Minister Wang is a senior diplomat and an old friend of Nepal, who is aware of the development aspirations of Nepal and Nepalis. His visit is expected to be fruitful in taking the relations between the two countries to new heights.Foreign Minister Wang is the first highest foreign dignitary to visit Nepal after Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba assumed leadership of the government in July last year. It will be a golden opportunity to promote Nepal's national interest and expand the scope of cooperation. The government has made Nepal's national interest and development needs and priorities as its agenda to increase partnership and cooperation with China, the world's emerging power, during his stay here.A foreign ministry official stated that Nepal would hold in-depth discussions with a delegation led by Foreign Minister Wang regarding implementation of cooperation projects under the Belt and Road Initiative, a multi-billion dollar infrastructure development project put forward by China. The two sides will dwell on upgrading Nepal from a least-developed country to a middle-income country by 2030 and build physical infrastructure such as ports, roads, railways, air transport and communications within the Trans-Himalayan Multidimensional Connectivity Network to support Nepal's development agenda of achieving sustainable development goals.He said the Chinese foreign minister was visiting Nepal to convey the message of China's commitment to implementing the BRI and its Framework Agreement that could not move forward for the past five years owing to the pandemic.China has already proposed the project implementation plan of BRI with Nepal for final approval and the Government of Nepal is ready to finalise it during this visit.During talks between the foreign ministers of Nepal and China on Saturday, the Nepali side is all set to request joint inspection of the border, which has been stalled for more than a decade, reopening of Rasuwagadhi and Tatopani (major trade ports between Nepal and China), resumption of flights and addressing the problems faced by Nepali students who returned home to escape the pandemic, the official shared.The foreign ministry official also said that Nepal would raise issues including the implementation of the agreements reached during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to Nepal and the visit of former prime minister KP Sharma Oli to China. Discussions are on between various ministries of the Government of Nepal to finalise the agenda of the meeting between Chinese and Nepali foreign ministers on Saturday. During the visit of the Chinese foreign minister, an agreement will be signed to export grass from Nepal and Nepal will receive additional Chinese grant under technical and economic assistance. ""Discussions between senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance on the annual assistance to Nepal under grant and technical and financial assistance is in the process of finalisation,"" an official at the Ministry of Finance said. China has hinted it could increase its annual aid this year, the official said.Such visits from time to time will help understand each other and address grievances as well as renew the relationship.The age-old Nepal-China friendship that has been nurtured by Araniko and Bhrikuti has been flourishing since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1955. The tradition of friendly cooperation and high-level visits have further enhanced the bond of affinity for the mutual benefit of both countries.A version of this article appears in the print on March 23, 2022, of The Himalayan Times.","['March 23, 2022', 'annual', 'centuries-old', 'this year', '2030', 'more than a decade', 'this weekend', 'Saturday', 'three years', 'July last year', 'the past five years', '1955']","['China', 'Nepal', 'Araniko', 'Bhrikuti']","['the Ministry of Finance', 'BRI', 'the Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'Chinese State Councillor and Foreign', 'Framework Agreement', 'the Government of Nepal', 'Nepal-China', 'The Himalayan Times', 'the Trans-Himalayan Multidimensional Connectivity Network']","['Tatopani', 'Nepalis', 'Nepal', 'Xi Jinping', 'KP Sharma', 'Sher Bahadur Deuba', 'Wang', 'Rasuwagadhi', 'Wang Yi']",thehimalayantimes

Nonetheless, diplomacy may be used to form alliances during conflicts in order to preserve the balance of power or to create a scenario in which a war on favourable terms becomes plausible.Wedge states are those small states that are able to enlarge their strategic autonomy and accrue material benefits from two rival powers, due primarily to their geographic location, ideological inclination or strategic self-interest. Is Nepal, as a ""wedge state"", likely to become a pawn between Washington and Beijing's rivalry? Will Nepal benefit materially from its inherent position? The MCC deal, a US$ 500 million grant by the US for building electricity transmission lines in addition to improving the road infrastructure, is viewed by many as an attempt by America to counter China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), under which Beijing aims to expand its influence in Asia, Europe and Africa by reviving the silk route.Furthermore, MCC is also viewed as part of Washington's Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) that has military components to deal with a range of transnational threats and challenges, possibly aimed at countering China. This strategy recognises India as ""a like-minded partner and leader in South Asia and the Indian Ocean"" ... ""a driving force of the QUAD and other regional fora, and an engine for regional growth and development.""Another school of thought views the MCC as a positive step in the direction of overall development of Nepal. MCC had long been debated along these lines by the ruling coalition and other parties. Amidst apprehensions of it being violative of the sovereign interests of Nepal, the MCC deal was ratified on February 27, 2022, with the condition that failure to accept the attached ""interpretative declaration"" by the US would result in non-implementation of the compact by the Government of Nepal.The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has welcomed the ratification by Nepal's House of Representatives.On most occasions, China is accused of interfering in Nepal's internal affairs, and the issue of ratifying the MCC was heavily politicised due to the question of national sovereignty. Critics argued that China could be behind the initial opposition to the MCC, opposed as it is to the IPS. Nepal's long border with Tibet is yet another contentious issue for China in its engagement with Nepal.China, as a communist state, accuses the US as an imperialist power trying to initiate a 'new war' by triggering hostilities against China and strengthening ties with India and other allies such as Japan, Australia and the UK on its behalf.This is because Nepal is viewed as territory of strategic importance by China. On certain issues, such as the deadline set by America for the ratification of MCC, China emerged as Nepal's ally in opposing ""coercive diplomacy"" and supporting the Nepali people's right to choose their path of development independently.India chose to remain silent on the MCC controversy stating it was a bilateral issue between Nepal and the US. The MCC project involves a cross-border electricity transmission line between Nepal and India, a part of which is to be built on Indian territory and may thus be regarded as a win-win situation for the two countries.China, on the other hand, has been criticised by the US for pursuing its own national and political interests by enhancing its global leadership and world dominance under the guise of providing financial aid and assistance, especially Third World nations.Chinese assistance is seen by low-income countries, such as Bangladesh, as an important source of development funds when international institutions such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are reluctant to finance infrastructure projects.It would be relevant to note that Chinese assistance to Nepal can be categorised as grants, interest-free loans and concessional loans. Some of the major ongoing projects being undertaken with Chinese assistance include the Upper Trishuli Hydropower Project - power station and transmission lines (concessional loan); food/ material assistance (grant) at 15 bordering districts of northern Nepal; Kathmandu Ring Road Improvement Project with flyovers (grant); and Pokhara International Regional Airport (loan). However, caution is required in Nepal's negotiations with the Chinese side owing to the obscurity of China's terms and conditions regarding BRI projects.Given Nepal's geo-strategic location, major nations have had open or covert roles in trying to influence its domestic affairs. Big powers, in particular, have attempted to influence the Nepali establishment in order to further their own interests.The conflicting geopolitical interests of the big powers may impact economic and development projects, such as the BRI and Transit and Transportation Agreement with China, which, in turn, may adversely affect the economy of Nepal as well as its diplomatic relations with other countries. The transit agreement has seen no progress since its inception.The status is similar with respect to BRI as well. It will be interesting to see the mode of implementation of the MCC compact and whether it brings positive or negative consequences with it.Adhikari is an LLM graduate from Bangor University, UKA version of this article appears in the print on March 18, 2022, of The Himalayan Times","['February 27, 2022', 'March 18, 2022']","['China', 'Beijing', 'US', 'Japan', 'India', 'Nepal', 'Washington', 'QUAD', 'Australia', 'Bangladesh', 'UK', 'America', 'Tibet']","['Bangor University', 'the Asian Development Bank', 'BRI', 'The Himalayan Times', 'Indo-Pacific Strategy', 'the Millennium Challenge Corporation', 'MCC', 'the Upper Trishuli Hydropower Project - power', 'Pokhara International Regional Airport', 'UKA', 'the World Bank', 'LLM', 'the Government of Nepal', 'Kathmandu Ring Road Improvement Project', 'House of Representatives', 'The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'Transit and Transportation Agreement']","['Adhikari', 'Nepal', 'BRI', 'Will Nepal']",thehimalayantimes

The Government of Nepal does not have full ownership of such projects, but the MCC projects will be under the ownership of the Government of Nepal,"" Mahat said, adding that Nepal would be happy to receive such grants from any other countries if the same terms and conditions stated in the MCC deal were stated in other countries or donors' deal.Mahat said the MCC deal would also be beneficial for Nepal as it would help Nepal set its grants and loan assistance processes. ""Tomorrow we can ask other donors to provide us assistance on the lines of the MCC deal, so it will be beneficial for Nepal,"" he added.Mahat said all the prime ministers after 2012, including Baburam Bhattarai, KP Sharma Oli, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, KP Sharma Oli and Sher Bahadur Deuba, were involved in the MCC deal process. He also said the provision for parliamentary ratification was inserted in the deal when KP Sharma Oli was the prime minister.Mahat said his party had called all the parties to support the MCC deal. He said his party was not concerned about the fate of the current ruling coalition due to the MCC deal ratification process.Mahat said his party believed that the country should carry out its foreign relations with other countries on the basis of same norms and values.When asked if the government should proceed with belt and road initiative projects that Nepal had signed with China, Mahat said he had himself signed the project when he was the foreign minister and if the BRI projects would be beneficial for Nepal, then the government would decide to move ahead with the project.When asked to comment on the recent remarks made by China's foreign ministry spokesperson about the MCC deal, Mahat said Nepal had not faced any pressure from the US. He said the American authorities had told Nepali leaders that Nepal had signed the MCC deal and therefore the country should conclude the deal soon, which was natural.On February 18, China's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said during a regular press briefing in Beijing that China had opposed coercive diplomacy and actions that pursued selfish agenda at the expense of Nepal's sovereignty and interests.Wang's remarks came after a journalist asked him to comment on US State Department spokesperson's recent statement that Nepal must decide whether it would ratify the MCC compact between the two countries by February 28, otherwise it would have an impact on US-Nepal bilateral relations.A version of this article appears in the print on February 22, 2022, of The Himalayan Times.","['today', 'February 22, 2022', 'February 28', 'Tomorrow', 'February 18', '2012']","['China', 'Beijing', 'US', 'the United States', 'Baburam Bhattarai']","['Foreign Ministry', 'The Himalayan Times', 'BRI', 'US State Department', 'the Millennium Challenge Corporation', 'MCC', 'the Government of Nepal', 'Wang', 'The Government of Nepal', 'Nepali Congress Spokesperson']","['KP Sharma Oli', 'Nepal', 'Mahat', 'Wang Wenbin', 'Sher Bahadur Deuba', 'Kamal Dahal', 'Sharan Mahat']",thehimalayantimes
https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/anatomy-of-mcc-complexitiesa-lesson-for-political-parties,Anatomy of MCC complexities: A lesson for political parties,2022-02-21 11:46,"The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) compact was concentrated on national politics until the United States Assistant Secretary of State Donald Lu called upon three senior Nepali leaders on the 10th of February to either accept the aid or face the consequences.The U.S. secretary's call is taken as a serious note in Nepal's relations with the US and also provides us a picture of US insecurity over China's rising influence in Nepal.This insecurity further gets bolstered with Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin's statement that recent developments on the MCC compact shows America's 'coercive diplomacy'.Following this, the current developments of the gloomy and changing relations among Nepal, the US and China are a result of a lack of understanding of the changing global and regional powers by Nepali politicians, lack of their expertise in foreign policy, and rising insecurity of the US and China.I have read and watched hundreds of articles and interviews whereas I did my Master's research on the MCC compact and examined the agency of the local actors (political parties and development institutions) in Nepal in the ways in which they appropriated the Western-centric development discourses by simultaneously incorporating and localising them in the national setting.I interviewed several leaders of the political parties - the Nepali Congress, Maoist Centre and Communist Party of Nepal-UML (at the time the Nepal Communist Party) - and got an opportunity to know the foundations on which they set their opinions.At the intellectual level (especially among the youths), there is absence of a pragmatic analysis on the background of the compact, changing power dynamics of the Indo-Pacific region and the influence.There is an over-exaggeration of compact conditionalities made by the communist parties, whereas the Nepali Congress lacks systematic analysis of power relations and the future of confrontational politics between the major powers.Sadly, now everyone is an expert on the MCC.The story behind the creation of the MCC so far is well known to the public. It was created in 2004 after a long debate on the ineffectiveness of U.S. aid and rising dissatisfaction among the U.S. public about it.The MCC was considered to be a game-changer in international development as it would promote policies that backed a liberal market economy and privatisation.These policies would builda capital market economy, international organisations, multinational companies and liberalism in political terms.The propounders of the MCC believed that U.S. influence in the world (especially in the rising global south) could only be ensured with the promotion of liberalism, where Bill Clinton, back in 1994, stated that the ""democracies don't attack each other"".The MCC was built on this ideology that the best strategy to ensure the safety of the US was to promote U.S. policies.With the anonymous linkage of the MCC with the Indo-Pacific Strategy and obscure conditionalities, it has now created a distinctive mode on whether to accept or reject the aid. In this uncertainty, China (also India) seemed to signal to the political parties to reject the aid as both countries do not want increased US influence in NepalHowever, the rise of China and its increasing influence have diverted the ways the MCC was created.No one in the U.S. establishment ever imagined the growth of China and the rise of regional institutions (Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, New Development Bank, Belt and Road Initiative) within a decade that shook the foundation of U.S. influence in the global south, mainly in the Indo-pacific region.The introduction of the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) by the Trump Administration and linking the MCC to the IPS unlocked the first maze of stress that brings debate to Nepali politics and raises concerns of China, whereas the conditionalities/clauses have further complicated the compact.The established U.S. strategic framework for the Indo-Pacific aims to prevent China from establishing 'new, illiberal spheres of influence' that go beyond the Nepali non-alignment foreign policy principle. Although the US has clarified that the MCC is not a part of the IPS, the alignment of the MCC with the economic component of the IPS was noted as a serious transgression.Going back to the selection criteria, Nepal has done commendable work in promoting policies related to democracy, governance, health, education, economy and political rights, which mainly follow liberalism.The political parties were positive about the MCC; however, with the anonymous linkage of the MCC with IPS and obscure conditionalities, it has now created a distinctive mode on whether to accept or reject the aid. In this uncertainty, China (also India) seemed to signal to the political parties to reject the aid as both countries do not want increased U.S. influence in Nepal.The political parties of Nepal are now under immense pressure on how to accept or reject the aid without destabilising the relations with US and China.From a realpolitik sense, it is a context of the changing realities of the region and increased rivalry between two great powers.With this, the fate of the MCC is no longer just limited to the Nepali parties but has extended to Washington DC and Beijing.In this mixed crisis, the best way to get rid of it is to ask for a written confirmation that the MCC is not a part of the IPS and is not directed against China. This can clear the insecurities of China and the communist parties while welcoming the MCC compact.The compact now has already taught the political parties how free aid can be a headache and a source of political conflict in a country.Let us hope that Nepal will least follow the aid mentality in the future.Bhandari is a research fellow at the United Nations University - Institute on Comparative Regional Integration Studies in BelgiumA version of this article appears in the print on February 21, 2022, of The Himalayan Times.","['February 21, 2022', 'the 10th of February', '2004', 'a decade', '1994']","['China', 'Beijing', 'US', 'Nepal', 'India', 'U.S.', 'the United States', 'Washington DC', 'NepalHowever', 'America']","['the Trump Administration', 'MCC', 'New Development Bank', 'The Millennium Challenge Corporation', 'MCC.The', 'IPS', 'Bhandari', 'the Indo-Pacific', 'State', 'Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank', 'Nepali Congress', 'Belt and Road Initiative', 'the Nepal Communist Party', 'the United Nations University - Institute on Comparative Regional Integration Studies', 'the Nepali Congress', 'Chinese Foreign Ministry', 'The Himalayan Times', 'Maoist Centre', 'the Indo-Pacific Strategy', 'Communist Party of Nepal-UML']","['Nepal', 'Donald Lu', ""Wang Wenbin's"", 'Bill Clinton']",thehimalayantimes
https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-time-for-consensus,EDITORIAL: Time for consensus,2022-02-18 11:19,"The Nepal government has a February 28 deadline to meet to approve the MCC agreement in the parliament, failing which the country would lose $500 million in grants from the U.S. government for two major projects – transmission lines and road rehabilitation.The CPN-MC and the CPN-US (Unified Socialist) along with fringe communist parties have been insisting that the compact could not be passed in its present form without amending certain clauses, a request turned down by the MCC saying it was too late to do so.From mere exchanges of arguments in the media, the MCC controversy has snowballed into violent activities in the streets. Wednesday saw a Nepal bandh, called by the Netra Bikram Chand-led Communist Party of Nepal, after many months, to protest against the MCC deal, and this could be just a precursor to the many more rough days ahead in the run-up to its ratification. At least 150 cadres of various parties were rounded up in Kathmandu for engaging in violent activities, with the police having to use water cannons and fire tear gas shells at the protesters who were trying to break the security cordon around the parliament building at New Baneswore. It, however, does not augur well for the coalition partners to have their cadres out in the streets to protest against the MCC deal. Leaders of the CPN-MC and the CPN-US were in one way or the other involved in pushing the deal forward. The MCC process began in 2012 when Baburam Bhattarai of the CPN-MC was the prime minister, although he is now with the Janata Samajbadi Party. The agreement was signed by PM Deuba in September 2017 as head of the coalition that had the CPN-MC as a partner. And the government of KP Sharma Oli had registered the MCC deal in the parliament in July 2019 after getting it endorsed by his cabinet.It is time those opposing the deal stopped beating about the bush and spelt out what actually is wrong with the MCC. Some have been claiming that the MCC is opposed to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). If so, the people have the right to know. No one has opposed the BRI, and there is no reason why anyone should go against the MCC deal. Quite unlike previous U.S. aid, the MCC agreement is pouring money explicitly into tangible projects that are set to benefit millions of people. Its success could prompt other countries to take up similar development projects in the country. All the parties must therefore reach a consensus on the issue without much fuss in the interest of the nation and its people.Karnali's woesThe official neglect in extending development services to Karnali zone has been so long and profound that it will take unprecedented political will to bring it into the national development mainstream.The remoteness of the region aside, other geographical features, such as unequal ratio between population density and cultivable land, have been blamed for the tardiness in tackling poverty, inequality and acute shortage of essential services. But the fact remains that services related to quality health, food access and a good education, among others, without which nothing much could be changed in the people's attitude and lifestyle, are sorely lacking. It is a pity that even after all the rhetoric about development, decentralisation, self-governance, donations and loans that pour into Nepal in the name of the poor, they have failed to reach the real needy in Karnali.The abject poverty that persists despite pleas made to the centre is one of the reasons behind the negative sentiments among the populace. There is need for long-term planning which would stimulate the development in this region. Continued isolation of the region will further propel Karnali into darkness.A version of this article appears in the print on February 18, 2022, of The Himalayan Times.","['July 2019', 'February 28', 'many months', 'Wednesday', 'February 18, 2022', 'September 2017', '2012']","['China', 'Nepal', 'U.S.', 'New Baneswore', 'Kathmandu']","['CPN', 'Karnali', 'MCC', 'the Netra Bikram Chand', 'the Janata Samajbadi Party', 'Socialist', 'The Himalayan Times', 'the CPN-US', 'Communist Party of Nepal']","['KP Sharma Oli', 'bush', 'BRI', 'Deuba', 'Baburam Bhattarai']",thehimalayantimes
https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/bangladeshs-persistent-economic-growth-china-factor-and-indias-security-threat,Bangladesh's persistent economic growth: China factor and India's security threat,2022-02-11 11:30,"Since its independence, Bangladesh has made great strides. Being battered by initial pessimism, refugees, wrecked infrastructure and abandoned factories, it was left with no foreign exchange reserves. Natural calamities and famine had driven the economy to the brink of collapse. Bangladesh's prosperity is due to the presence of a single and central nation, a singular language and culture, the acceptance of diversity, authorising privatisation, and encouraging foreign investments.The former ""Banana Republic"", reliant on jute goods, had pushed the primary sector below the bottom of the list. Bangladesh now produces every second T-shirt. Backward linkages, such as garment accessory button and zipper manufacturers, are rising in lockstep with the readymade garment (RMG) industries.Domestic industries, agriculture, tanneries, pharmaceuticals, glass, plastic, cement and steel sectors are all nurtured by the government, resulting in an economic boom in clusters. Bangladesh, like every other country, was plagued by the epidemic and was compelled to institute a lockdown, which momentarily halted the economic progress that is dependent on '3Rs': RMG, rice and remittance.With the initial shock, the RMG sector had swung.Because ports were temporarily closed and delivery deadlines were missed, export orders were canceled.But, amazingly, the industry rebounded in just a few months. Since the March 2020 shutdown, the months of July and August have witnessed more exports than the prior two years. Bangladesh's agriculture industry handled the pandemic-induced shock remarkably. Apart from a few floods, the agriculture industry did admirably, cushioning any large-scale employment losses.During the epidemic, remittance inflows soared by a huge margin, and the government aided the process by providing incentives.It functioned as the primary shock absorber.Moreover, a stable macroeconomy and static exchange rate have kept the double-digit growth of Bangladesh going for a decade.Except for a few occasional setbacks, Bangladesh's economy is thriving.Bangladesh's economy has been booming despite the epidemic, while others have been suffering. Its economy will remain open to international investment.To entice such investments, Bangladesh has established hundreds of special economic zones, which house all manufacturing and exporting facilities and allow international investors to safely trade their currencies. Korea, Japan, China and India have all invested in these special economic zones.Bangladesh is likely to experience a transition shock when it graduates from LDC status. It will lose between 8 per cent and 10 per cent of its gross export gain. However, with domestic reforms, such as increased labor productivity, improved tax collection, a lower tax-to-GDP ratio, and more domestic resource collection, the transition can be smoothed.Bangladesh has benefitted from the trade war between the United States and China, as well as the continual tug-of-war between India and China.Bangladesh's physical proximity to China, as well as the two nations' strong economic potential, suggests that China will become an even more important trade and development partner for Bangladesh in the coming years.China wants Bangladesh to join the Belt and Road Initiative, which benefits China's economy. Another reason for China's interest in Bangladesh is to limit Indian influence in the area, which it has mostly succeeded.All of India's neighbours (Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Pakistan) have become targets for Chinese investment. Bangladesh's geostrategic importance will provide China a broad reach over the Bay of Bengal, allowing it to keep a close eye on the Indian subcontinent. Until now, Bangladesh has been a shrewd operator. India, on the other hand, is concerned about the likelihood of Bangladesh joining Chinese hands.Due to their differing economies and agility, India and China are unable to compete financially. China will have finished building a bridge or a number of motorways by the time India finalises a contract. India must concentrate on the historic relations and collaboration while also resolving first-generation issues, such as the Teesta River problem and border killings. People in Bangladesh frequently perceive India as a bully and feel that Bangladesh has never received its fair share because they are unable to understand figures. India must pay previous debts and move forward to become Bangladesh's economic and security partner.The collaborative venture between Bangladesh and India's Defence Research and Development Organisation's Dhanush artillery gun may develop ships, radars and missiles.It will meet the needs of Bangladesh's Armed Forces (which are controlled by Chinese businesses to the tune of 86 percent), as well as safeguard India's strategic interests and promote the Indian government's 'Aatma-nirbhar Bharat' flagship. The capacity of India and Bangladesh to share marine domain awareness can also be improved.Bangladesh's economic progress has a favourable impact on India's economy because it is one of the country's top export destinations.Bangladesh may be India's sole neighbour who can support India both strategically and economically, and vice versa.Bangladesh, on the other hand, piques the interest of India's adversaries. But India must remember, in geo-politics, friends and foes may change, but not neighbours.George is a PhD fellow at University of Texas, with a master's degree in strategic studiesIndia must concentrate on the historic relations and collaboration while also resolving first-generation issues, such as the Teesta River problem and border killings.A version of this article appears in the print on February 11, 2022, of The Himalayan Times.","['the coming years', 'a decade', ""'3Rs'"", 'March 2020', 'the months of July', 'the prior two years', 'just a few months', 'August', 'February 11, 2022']","['China', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'India', 'Nepal', 'Myanmar', 'the United States', 'Bangladesh', 'Pakistan', 'Sri Lanka']","['Bharat', 'the Belt and Road Initiative', 'Bangladesh', ""Bangladesh's Armed Forces"", ""Defence Research and Development Organisation's Dhanush"", 'RMG', 'The Himalayan Times', 'University of Texas']","['George', 'Aatma']",thehimalayantimes

They also attack Chinese projects, and occasionally kill Chinese workers despite Pakistani assurances that it is doing everything it can to protect the projects.China is involved in the development of the Gwadar port and other projects in the province as part of a $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which is part of Beijing's Belt and Road initiative.China has been raising its security concerns with Pakistan, especially after 10 Chinese workers were killed and 26 were wounded in an attack in northern Pakistan last year.Pakistan has approved $11.6 million in compensation for the victims' families.Khan and his team would be exploring economic opportunities on the visit to Beijing, including trying to persuade Chinese businesses to set up in Pakistan, Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin said.","['decades', 'Thursday', 'last year', 'years', 'Last week']","['China', 'Beijing', 'Pakistan', 'Balochistan']","['The Baloch Liberation Army', 'Reuters', 'Interior', 'Finance', 'BLF']","['Khan', 'Xi Jinping', 'Imran Khan', 'Rasheed Ahmad', 'Shaukat Tarin']",thehimalayantimes
https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-strengthen-bimstec,EDITORIAL: Strengthen BIMSTEC,2022-01-07 09:34,"There are fears that BIMSTEC could go the way of SAARC – which remained no more than a talking shop since its inception in 1985 due to India-Pakistan rivalry – if cooperation among the member countries is not tangible, especially on the economic and trade fronts.BIMSTEC has outlined 14 broad areas of cooperation, including trade, science and technology, energy, poverty alleviation, agriculture, security, anti-terrorism, climate change and health, but it wasn't until recently that they pledged to work together in one area – in the fight against COVID-19. But after two decades of stagnancy, BIMSTEC is showing some vitality.Even if it has taken 23 years, the regional body was able to finalise its charter in September last year. BIMSTEC is also taking connectivity initiatives to link the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal, such as the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway and the Kaladan Multimodal Transit Transport Project that provides sea access for India's landlocked northeastern states via the Kaladan River in Myanmar. Within the BIMSTEC framework, Nepal has been trying to integrate with the Bay of Bengal through connectivity and energy cooperation, with Bangladesh even proposing a solar power grid in the BIMSTEC countries.BIMSTEC countries, with a population of 1.6 billion people, or 23 per cent of the global population, hold immense potential for trade and investment.Yet, despite a combined GDP of $2.7 trillion, interregional trade barely exceeds 5 per cent, compared to 30 per cent for ASEAN. To give a boost to interregional trade, a free trade agreement (FTA) would be necessary, a vision that has been dragging on for nearly two decades. For this, countries would need to be more outward looking, otherwise it will meet the same fate as that of SAPTA and SAFTA among the SAARC countries. But trade cannot foster in the absence of connectivity. If FTA is to be the vision for BIMSTEC in the future, then connectivity should receive high priority, which means better roads, rails, ports, river navigation and airports. BIMSTEC must speed up connectivity and other projects to rival China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) that promotes mind-boggling infrastructure across South and Southeast Asia. For the success of BIMSTEC, the member countries must give up their individual narrow interests for the common good of the organisation and reach a consensus on the economic and security agenda.Find lasting solutionLandslides render many families homeless every year during the rainy season that continues for four months from June. Once such families lose their houses and farmland, they will never be able to return to normal life that they used to lead before the natural calamity struck them. The government does not have any concrete plan to settle them in safer areas so that they can eke out a living in the new settlements.Most of the landslide-affected families take refuge on roadsides or in forest areas for many years without support from the government.A report from Hupsekot Rural Municipality in Nawalparasi states that as many as 128 people from 18 households have been living under the open sky since they were displaced due to landslides last August.First, they were relocated to a local school temporarily as the school was shut due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As the school has now opened, they have been moved to a place where a bus park is being built. Where will they go after the bus park comes into operation? This is not an isolated case. Therefore, the government needs to come up with a longterm solution to permanently resettle the people displaced by natural disasters every year.A version of this article appears in the print on January 7, 2022, of The Himalayan Times.","['the rainy season', '1985', 'January 7, 2022', '23 years', 'nearly two decades', 'last August', 'every year', 'four months from June', 'many years', 'two decades', 'September last year']","['China', 'India', 'Myanmar', 'Nawalparasi', 'Pakistan', 'BIMSTEC']","['The Himalayan Times', 'FTA', 'SAPTA', 'the Kaladan Multimodal Transit Transport Project', 'SAARC', 'Bangladesh', 'COVID-19', 'SAFTA', 'BIMSTEC', 'ASEAN']","['Nepal', 'Hupsekot Rural Municipality', 'BRI']",thehimalayantimes

Collective action will be more effective to secure commitments that Afghanistan will never ever allow its territory to attack othersThe 9/11 terrorist attacks on America came at a time when the United States enjoyed unlimited power. In October 2001, the US launched military attacks in Afghanistan ""to disrupt the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations and to attack the military capability of the Taliban regime"". Enduring freedom was the name given to this operation.The 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks marked the end of the war on terrorism. US President Joe Biden in a speech said it is up to the ""Afghan leaders to come together, fight for themselves, fight for their nation."" On September 7, Taliban hoisted their flag over the presidential palace and unveiled their interim government: all male, no women, and overwhelmingly Pushtuns.The Taliban will have to take quick, visible and credible steps to convince the international community about their adherence to international obligations, including respecting human rights for women and minorities.International recognition will be significant even for humanitarian supplies and aid.The Afghanistan experience shows no armed approach to nation-building.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that using force to ""remake a country is beyond our means and capacity"".Methods ""to promote stability and human warfare"" are needed.Political scientist Minxin Pei identified requirements for the success of regime change that include strong national identity, a high degree of ethnic homogeneity and relative socio-economic equality. None of this existed in Afghanistan.As the U.S. President prepares to convene a Leaders' Summit for Democracy on December 9 and 10, to ""galvanise commitments and initiatives across three principal themes: defending against authoritarianism, fighting corruption and promoting respect for human rights"", America will have to show the power of example as the President has reiterated time and again, ""We will lead not merely by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.""Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi says the US must refrain from ""creating more problems and dumping the burden on regional countries"".Though it is not yet clear if China will ""step into the void"" created by the US withdrawal, the Taliban are reported to have offered a red carpet for China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).China seems determined to pursue cooperation with the Taliban.The Taliban would need U.S. goodwill, support and cooperation for peace, stabilisation and reconstruction in Afghanistan. Their meeting with the CIA director and asking the US to retain its embassy in Kabul provide some signs of the evolving scenario. It is no secret that the Taliban survived essentially in Pakistani sanctuaries.Reports indicate signs of al Qaeda fighters returning to Afghanistan.Given the past, the West should not abandon Afghanistan like it did in 1989. The internationalcommunity should work together to ensure that terrorist groups are not allowed to flourish on Afghan soil.The return of the Taliban to Kabul is a wakeup call for the most geo-strategically significant South Asian region.Geopolitical trends put India and Pakistan in opposite directions.Afghanistan's location and rare mineral depositsat the crossroads of Central, South and Southwest Asia makes it geopolitically attractive for all powers. Afghanistan has been the termed as ""the graveyard of empires"".South Asia's unity in diversity is its strength. With obscurantist fundamentalists in Kabul, rising ultranationalism and elected authoritarianism in the region, traditional ethnic identities may stage a comeback and fuel rivalries in diverse societies compounded by repeated interstate wars and intrastate conflicts. Afghanistan descending into civil war is a worst-case scenario for neighbours, the region and the world.For India, the Taliban's return is a strategic setback.The takeover threatens to raise India-Pakistan tensions.The Economist writes: ""India must face the prospect of a new generation of Muslim Kashmiris inspired by the Taliban's fanaticism.""Before the geopolitical situation goes extraordinarily dangerous with the possibility of engulfing the entire region, countries in the region have to come together to save South Asia.The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)stands as the most ideal forum to bring all South Asians together, and work to prevent Afghanistan from descending into chaos and disorder.Collective action will be more effective to secure commitments that Afghanistan will never ever allow its territory to attack others.It seems withdrawal from Afghanistan was a tactical shift to focus on the larger objectives. A shift in geopolitics in the Indo-Pacific is distinctly visible in the form of a new trilateral security partnership – AUK- US, between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. This arrangement is to help Australia build a nuclear-propelled submarine. President Biden calls it ""investing in our greatest source of strength – our alliances"", moving from ""relentless war"" with ""relentless diplomacy""–covering a wide range of diplomatic and technological collaboration, from cybersecurity to artificial intelligence.Washington is hosting leaders of the QUAD – Australia, India and Japan on September 24 in person for the first time, seeking to boost cooperation, focus on 'China's growing assertiveness, Afghanistan, climate change and supply chain resiliency'.9/11 showed that the source of threats to the international community in the 21st century originates not from powerful states but from weak and vulnerable states.

Only 80 km out of estimated 800-km length of transmission line lies within Nepali territory. The Nepali portion of the power line will stretch from Galchhi in Dhading district to Rasuwagadhi on the border with China in the north.Komalnath Atreya, head of the project, informed that the project is currently analysing the ‘load flow test’ before finalising the DPR of the project. The load flow is basically done for the power flow through a transmission line and the transmission line performance between the sending and receiving ends.“After we complete the load flow test, we will be able to complete the DPR of the transmission line project which has the capacity to transmit up to 5,000 megawatts of electricity,” he said, adding that currently the project is analysing the flow of electricity through a software called Nepal Power System.The Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation, on May 8, 2018, had unveiled a plan and had set a target to generate 3,000 megawatts of electricity within three years and connect it to the national grid. Likewise, the energy ministry had also stated that it would generate 5,000 MW of energy within five years and 15,000 MW of electricity within 10 years.The government has plans to export the electricity to India, Bangladesh and China in the future. As per this plan, the government has expedited the works to begin negotiations with the neighbouring countries.In January, 2018, the government had forwarded the initial feasibility report of the cross-border transmission line to China.The government had proposed this project to China through Ministry of Finance with expectations of potential Chinese financing under its Belt and Road Initiative.Nepal Electricity Authority and State Grid of China in 2017 had agreed to jointly prepare the DPR.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/nepali-congress-leadership-decisions-to-influence-national-convention,NC leadership decisions to influence national convention,2020-01-06 09:59,"To begin with, the Nepali Congress has lately received lots of media coverage, but not for good reasons. What’s wrong with the party?The problem is the very weak organisational management of the party. When we talk of a party, there are various aspects such as its history, ideology, leadership and organisation. No other party has as glorious a history as the NC. It has led every political movement in Nepal. The NC advocated and promoted liberal democracy and everybody accepted it. The NC’s philosophy— first bringing transformation by formulating laws against feudalism, and then heralding liberal economy and promoting socialistic philosophy — is also accepted by everybody.The party’s history is glorious and its ideology is accepted by all, but the problems are: weaknesses in the present leadership and organisational management, rampant factionalism, and individualism. That’s why the general impression is that the NC has not been able to play an effective role as opposition.There’s so much disappointment and frustration among people from the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP). This is because of mismanagement, poor governance, rampant corruption, various scandals, price hike and exorbitant taxation. However, the NC has not been able to capitalise on the growing frustration among people and weaknesses of the government largely because of its internal problems.Who’s promoting factionalism in the party? Is it NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba, or senior leaders such as Ramchandra Paudel and you, who are boycotting party meetings seeking certain percentage of seats in party bodies?When the leadership accommodates all, listens to all and exhibits openness, there’s no chance of factionalism. The leadership can discourage factionalism by becoming more accommodating and more open to various ideas. So it is the leadership that needs to play a crucial role in discouraging factionalism. However, if the leadership starts strengthening its faction, others will naturally oppose. If there is a complaint against the leadership, the leadership must listen and address grievances. That’s not happening in our party.For instance, the leadership recently took a majority decision and suspended various clauses of the party’s statute. The move is aimed at strengthening one faction of the party.The four-year tenure of the party leadership has almost expired, and as per the statute provision, the term can be extended by one more year. So at this moment, our priority should have been holding an early national convention and ensuring that the convention is held fairly.However, some of the recent unilateral decisions such as suspending statute clauses are aimed at influencing the national convention and ensuring that the outcome of the convention benefits one faction. That’s why the recent boycotts.The disgruntled leaders want things to move ahead on the basis of consensus, not majority, to ensure that the upcoming national convention is held in an impartial manner. They are of the view that the leadership must correct its way of functioning and work in line with the spirit of the party’s statute.You have pointed out that the NC leadership has failed to capitalise on the government’s failures and people’s frustrations. What’s the way forward for the NC?The NC has not been able to instil optimism in the people. For this, the party has to be united. To unite the party, the leadership must be competent. We can still reform the party. Who will be the best party leader is something to be decided by the party’s next convention.Is the leadership willing to reform the party?The party’s leader is responsible for the party’s management. Whoever is the main functionary with all the powers, that person should play the major role. For example, all party members are responsible for loss in the election, but the president has moral responsibility. Therefore, I say there must be self-introspection at all levels — from the lowest to the highest. Naturally, the responsibility of top-level leadership is more serious than that of the lower level.The general impression is that the existing leadership cannot reform the party until and unless there’s dramatic improvement in the management and organisational style of leadership. Only this will strengthen the party, generate public support and create confidence among the people.As you’ve said the NC has failed to generate public support as expected, how do you see the NC’s performance in the next general elections?We must reform ourselves to perform well in the next general elections. If we reform ourselves, there are plenty of opportunities. We need to reform our organisation, hold timely national convention, discourage factionalism and forge unity in the party. For that the leadership must play an effective role. The NC is ahead in all aspects due to its glorious history and ideology, but we must sort out our managerial and organisational weaknesses. If we do not address factionalism and other weaknesses, it will be difficult. So we do not have any option, but to reform ourselves.How do you evaluate the government’s performance?The government’s activities suggest it is headed towards authoritarianism. For example, the government is trying to curtail press freedom and autonomy of the National Human Rights Commission, the transitional justice process is stuck halfway and power is concentrated at the prime minister’s office. We have a new federal structure and multiple governments. The constitution has guaranteed rights to the governments, but the federal government is reluctant to ensure that other governments enjoy their rights. Many laws are yet to be adopted. There are various jurisdictional conflicts. The federal government is least bothered about institution building. Institutional capacity building — professional and technical — of provincial governments has not happened.There’s also rampant politicisation of institutions. There’s lack of meritocracy and professionalism. Appointments are made on the basis of political affiliation. I see a crisis of governance. This has also negatively affected the entire economy. As far as the bills aimed at curbing freedom of expression and civil liberties are concerned, we stand dead against them. There’s no doubt about it.On the foreign relations front, what are your views on the current debate on the Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact Programme?The present debate on the MCC is uncalled for and unwarranted. The debate is basically due to lack of knowledge. The US is extending the MCC assistance not for its benefits, but for Nepal’s benefits. We’ve asked for it. The MCC extends assistance to countries where there’s democratic system, where people enjoy civil and political liberties, where there’s liberal economic system and where there’s investment-friendly economic policy. There are various stages to pass. For example, the first stage is threshold stage. We applied in 2011 and passed the threshold stage. When I was finance minister in December 2014, Nepal qualified for the compact agreement — the highest assistance under the MCC.Since the compelling development hindrance in Nepal is poor infrastructure, we decided to utilise the assistance on road maintenance and transmission line development. After that we established an office of the MCC in Nepal during my tenure to select specific projects. In consultation with experts, we selected projects and in 2017 we signed an agreement.In the terms and conditions of the agreement that we signed, there’s no single political matter. All these rumours about the MCC being against Nepal’s foreign policy of non-alignment and MCC possibly resulting in military alliance with the US are totally false. Nepal was selected on the basis of international competition. The whole purpose is the uplift of the living condition of Nepali people through economic growth by making very impressive investment in energy and road sectors. There are other positive features too, such as completion of projects within five years, transparency, fair auditing, financial discipline, and inclusiveness.However, a section of people are saying the MCC is part of the US-led Indo-Pacific Strategy just because an American official said so. They say MCC would lead to military alliance with the US. These are baseless arguments. Talking about security, the US has been supporting the Nepali Army. China, India and the UK are also supporting the Nepali Army. So that should not be a matter of concern. Coming back to the MCC, whatever terms and conditions we’ve agreed to, our commitment is only that much, and nothing else.Influential leaders of the ruling party are speaking publicly against the MCC. What if the pact is not ratified by the Parliament?Whatever the government has said, that’s official. I do not accord much importance to what party leaders say. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has said the government will get the pact endorsed from the House. Both the foreign and finance ministers have also said so. The opposition too has pledged its support. If the government stops MCC, the NC will strongly object.The MCC is one of the biggest single assistances. Nepal has been involved in the development of this assistance from the very beginning, and none of the terms and conditions are against the country.Receiving foreign assistance is in line with Nepal’s foreign policy. During the Cold War, we accepted assistance from both the US and Soviet Union. Therefore, we need to consider our interests rather than looking at the foreign policies of other countries. For example, we are a member of the Chinese-led Belt and Road Initiative. India might say the BRI is against it. Similarly, China might have launched the BRI to compete with the US, and the US might want to extend its influence through the IPS. These are their policies. What we need to look at is the paper that we have signed on. Our commitment is limited only to the terms and conditions that we have agreed to.What are your views on Nepal-India border dispute in Kalapani region?After the all-party meeting, the government has full support. Whatever historical facts and proofs we have, on that basis the government should claim Nepal’s land back. The government should make sure India rectifies its political map. We’ve also made mistakes in the past. We claimed only till Kalapani in the past and not till Limpiyadhura. Even our maps were erroneous and left out around 400 square kilometres of our land. So the government should hold dialogue with India at the diplomatic as well as political level and sort out this issue at the earliest.","['2017', 'five years', '2011', 'December 2014', 'four-year', 'one more year']","['NC', 'China', 'Soviet Union', 'US', 'Limpiyadhura', 'Nepal', 'India', 'Nepal-India', 'UK']","['House', 'NCP', 'the NC?The NC', 'Parliament?Whatever', 'the National Human Rights Commission', 'Nepal Communist Party', 'Indo-Pacific Strategy', 'MCC', 'the Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact', 'the Nepali Congress', 'Kalapani', 'the Nepali Army']","['KP Sharma Oli', 'BRI', 'Ramchandra Paudel', 'Nepal', 'Sher Bahadur Deuba', 'Kalapani']",thehimalayantimes

China, however, claims most of the South China Sea, through which more than $3.4 trillion worth of goods are transported every year.As a result, Malaysia said in its submission dated December 12 that there were areas of potential overlapping claims beyond its own exclusive economic zone.China said Malaysia's submission had ""seriously infringed on China’s sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction in the South China Sea"", the South China Morning Post said quoting a diplomatic note sent by China to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.""China has historic rights in the South China Sea,"" the Hong Kong newspaper quoted China's permanent mission to the United Nations as saying in the note.Malaysia's foreign ministry, the Chinese embassy in Kuala Lumpur and China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to queries from Reuters.Malaysia and Vietnam in 2009 made a joint submission for a portion of the two countries' continental shelf in the southern part of the South China Sea.A senior Vietnam official said last month it could explore legal action, among various options, in its territorial dispute with China over the waters.On Tuesday, Vietnam said it hoped China would show restraint in the South China Sea next year after a Chinese oil survey vessel and its escorts spent months within Vietnam's exclusive economic zone in what Hanoi called a blatant violation of its sovereignty.Vietnam, the region's most forceful challenger of China's extensive maritime claims to the busy waterway, will take on the rotating chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2020.The UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf said Malaysia's partial submission on the northern part would be included in the provisional agenda of its fifty-third session to be held in New York in 2021.Malaysia had been critical of China's South China Sea position but has been less outspoken recently, especially after China pumped billions of dollars into infrastructure projects under its Belt and Road Initiative.But Malaysia's foreign minister said in October the country needed to boost its naval capabilities to prepare for possible conflict in the South China Sea.","['2009', 'months', 'December 12', 'next year', 'October', '2021.Malaysia', 'last week', 'last month', 'every year', 'Tuesday']","['China', 'Hanoi', 'Hong Kong', 'Kuala Lumpur', 'New York', 'Vietnam', 'Malaysia']","['the United Nations', '2020.The UN Commission', 'the Association of Southeast Asian Nations', 'Reuters', 'the Continental Shelf', 'foreign ministry', 'UN', 'ASEAN', 'the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea']",['Antonio Guterres'],thehimalayantimes

Speaking on the occasion, Chief Minister Poudel commended Tibet’s achievement in the developmental sector.“Nepal will definitely benefit from the progress and development in the region just across the border. At the least, we can learn from the development in our immediate neighbourhood,” said Poudel, who also appreciated numerous understandings in the fields of road, railway, aviation and communication reached between Nepal and China under the auspices of Belt and Road Initiative.Further, praising Tibet’s support in resuming Tatopani-Jangmu entry point, Poudel asked for the Tibetan government’s help to promote Nepali commodities and goods in Tibet as a measure for bringing down the huge trade deficit existing between Nepal and China.Besides, the CM also informed the guest about the Government of Nepal’s target of welcoming two million tourists during the upcoming Visit Year 2020 and sought the help of the Tibetan government to meet the target.At the meeting, Qizhala also informed about his government’s willingness to collaborate in the development of agriculture, tourism, hydropower and road construction.

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/ap-exclusive-629-pakistani-girls-sold-as-brides-to-china,AP Exclusive: 629 Pakistani girls sold as brides to China,2019-12-04 16:37,"The list gives the most concrete figure yet for the number of women caught up in the trafficking schemes since 2018.But since the time it was put together in June, investigators’ aggressive drive against the networks has largely ground to a halt. Officials with knowledge of the investigations say that is because of pressure from government officials fearful of hurting Pakistan’s lucrative ties to Beijing.The biggest case against traffickers has fallen apart. In October, a court in Faisalabad acquitted 31 Chinese nationals charged in connection with trafficking. Several of the women who had initially been interviewed by police refused to testify because they were either threatened or bribed into silence, according to a court official and a police investigator familiar with the case. The two spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared retribution for speaking out.At the same time, the government has sought to curtail investigations, putting “immense pressure” on officials from the Federal Investigation Agency pursuing trafficking networks, said Saleem Iqbal, a Christian activist who has helped parents rescue several young girls from China and prevented others from being sent there.“Some (FIA officials) were even transferred,” Iqbal said in an interview. “When we talk to Pakistani rulers, they don’t pay any attention. “Asked about the complaints, Pakistan’s interior and foreign ministries refused to comment.Several senior officials familiar with the events said investigations into trafficking have slowed, the investigators are frustrated, and Pakistani media have been pushed to curb their reporting on trafficking. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared reprisals.“No one is doing anything to help these girls,” one of the officials said. “The whole racket is continuing, and it is growing. Why? Because they know they can get away with it. The authorities won’t follow through, everyone is being pressured to not investigate. Trafficking is increasing now.”He said he was speaking out “because I have to live with myself. Where is our humanity?”China’s Foreign Ministry said it was unaware of the list.“The two governments of China and Pakistan support the formation of happy families between their people on a voluntary basis in keeping with laws and regulations, while at the same time having zero tolerance for and resolutely fighting against any person engaging in illegal cross-border marriage behavior,” the ministry said in a statement faxed Monday to AP’s Beijing bureau.An AP investigation earlier this year revealed how Pakistan’s Christian minority has become a new target of brokers who pay impoverished parents to marry off their daughters, some of them teenagers, to Chinese husbands who return with them to their homeland. Many of the brides are then isolated and abused or forced into prostitution in China, often contacting home and pleading to be brought back. The AP spoke to police and court officials and more than a dozen brides — some of whom made it back to Pakistan, others who remained trapped in China — as well as remorseful parents, neighbors, relatives and human rights workers.Christians are targeted because they are one of the poorest communities in Muslim-majority Pakistan. The trafficking rings are made up of Chinese and Pakistani middlemen and include Christian ministers, mostly from small evangelical churches, who get bribes to urge their flock to sell their daughters. Investigators have also turned up at least one Muslim cleric running a marriage bureau from his madrassa, or religious school.Investigators put together the list of 629 women from Pakistan’s integrated border management system, which digitally records travel documents at the country’s airports. The information includes the brides’ national identity numbers, their Chinese husbands’ names and the dates of their marriages.All but a handful of the marriages took place in 2018 and up to April 2019. One of the senior officials said it was believed all 629 were sold to grooms by their families.It is not known how many more women and girls were trafficked since the list was put together. But the official said, “the lucrative trade continues.” He spoke to the AP in an interview conducted hundreds of kilometers from his place of work to protect his identity. “The Chinese and Pakistani brokers make between 4 million and 10 million rupees ($25,000 and $65,000) from the groom, but only about 200,000 rupees ($1,500), is given to the family,” he said.The official, with years of experience studying human trafficking in Pakistan, said many of the women who spoke to investigators told of forced fertility treatments, physical and sexual abuse and, in some cases, forced prostitution. Although no evidence has emerged, at least one investigation report contains allegations of organs being harvested from some of the women sent to China.In September, Pakistan’s investigation agency sent a report it labeled “fake Chinese marriages cases” to Prime Minister Imran Khan. The report, a copy of which was attained by the AP, provided details of cases registered against 52 Chinese nationals and 20 of their Pakistani associates in two cities in eastern Punjab province — Faisalabad, Lahore — as well as in the capital Islamabad. The Chinese suspects included the 31 later acquitted in court.The report said police discovered two illegal marriage bureaus in Lahore, including one operated from an Islamic center and madrassa — the first known report of poor Muslims also being targeted by brokers. The Muslim cleric involved fled police.After the acquittals, there are other cases before the courts involving arrested Pakistani and at least another 21 Chinese suspects, according to the report sent to the prime minister in September. But the Chinese defendants in the cases were all granted bail and left the country, say activists and a court official.Activists and human rights workers say Pakistan has sought to keep the trafficking of brides quiet so as not to jeopardise Pakistan’s increasingly close economic relationship with China.China has been a steadfast ally of Pakistan for decades, particularly in its testy relationship with India. China has provided Islamabad with military assistance, including pre-tested nuclear devices and nuclear-capable missiles.Today, Pakistan is receiving massive aid under China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a global endeavor aimed at reconstituting the Silk Road and linking China to all corners of Asia. Under the $75 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project, Beijing has promised Islamabad a sprawling package of infrastructure development, from road construction and power plants to agriculture.The demand for foreign brides in China is rooted in that country’s population, where there are roughly 34 million more men than women — a result of the one-child policy that ended in 2015 after 35 years, along with an overwhelming preference for boys that led to abortions of girl children and female infanticide.A report released this month by Human Rights Watch, documenting trafficking in brides from Myanmar to China, said the practice is spreading. It said Pakistan, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, North Korea and Vietnam have “all have become source countries for a brutal business.”“One of the things that is very striking about this issue is how fast the list is growing of countries that are known to be source countries in the bride trafficking business,” Heather Barr, the HRW report’s author, told AP.Omar Warriach, Amnesty International’s campaigns director for South Asia, said Pakistan “must not let its close relationship with China become a reason to turn a blind eye to human rights abuses against its own citizens” — either in abuses of women sold as brides or separation of Pakistani women from husbands from China’s Muslim Uighur population sent to “re-education camps” to turn them away from Islam.“It is horrifying that women are being treated this way without any concern being shown by the authorities in either country. And it’s shocking that it’s happening on this scale,” he said.","['June', 'April 2019', 'decades', '2015', 'years', 'this month', 'October', '2018', 'Monday', 'earlier this year', '35 years', 'the 31 later', 'September', 'up to', 'Today']","['China', 'Beijing', 'Islamabad', 'Faisalabad', 'Lahore', 'Cambodia', 'India', 'Nepal', 'Myanmar', 'North Korea', 'Indonesia', 'Laos', 'Vietnam', 'Pakistan']","['Foreign Ministry', 'AP', 'Human Rights Watch', 'Amnesty International’s', 'the Federal Investigation Agency', 'HRW', 'Islam']","['Saleem Iqbal', 'Lahore', 'Imran Khan', 'Heather Barr', 'AP.Omar Warriach', 'Iqbal']",thehimalayantimes

The Nepali delegation was led by Devendra Karki, secretary of Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport and the Chinese delegation was led by An Lusheng, deputy director of the National Railway Administration.“We have classified the works into various segments and assigned the responsibility to complete the works,” said Karki.“We have also agreed to conduct the DPR, detailed engineering and environment impact assessment (EIA) works simultaneously,” he added.As per the agreement, China will conduct the DPR and other engineering works and Nepal will provide support for the EIA preparation works. Similarly, the Nepal government will provide necessary security for Chinese officials while conducting engineering works on Nepal side.Karki further said that the Chinese government will conduct the DPR free of cost.“We have agreed to conduct the preparatory works of the project as per the agreement made by the heads of both the nations last month,” he said, adding that now the works will be expedited as per the commitment made by the heads of both the nations.As per Karki, China Railways First Survey and Design Institute Group, a Chinese firm, will do the DPR, EIA and other necessary engineering works.

The paper was prepared by Khagendra Prasai, a political researcher.At the event, the scholars discussed how the country should move ahead amidst the contemporary world order which is largely guided by ‘capitalism’, whereas neighbouring China is heading towards socialism.The research paper states that country’s socialist movement cannot determine its possibilities and direction until it understands the nature of current world order, its challenges, role of China and its direction and the creation of class in society and its struggle during the process.Prasai, in his paper, states that the country has to be clear about China’s global development strategy ‘Belt and Road Initiative’ as it is still not clear how Chinese socialism will transform itself in the coming years. Speaking at the event, Bam Dev Gautam, Nepal Communist Party (NCP)’s vice-chair, said BRI was China’s unprecedented move and Nepal could get huge support by being its member.Former attorney general Yubaraj Sangraula said although the country’s leaders claimed that Nepal was a democratic socialist country, it was unlikely the country would achieve socialism.","['the coming years', 'November 23Political']","['China', 'Nepal', 'Kathmandu']","['Nepal Communist Party', 'Foundation for Critical Discourse Nepal', 'NCP']","['Khagendra Prasai', 'Yubaraj Sangraula', 'BRI', 'Nepal', 'Bam Dev Gautam']",thehimalayantimes

The department has asked the people in the affected areas to provide their suggestions to the DED within 15 days.Nabin Raj Singh, director general of DED, said that they have expedited the works related to feasibility and ESIA studies. “We have also started making the people aware about the location of the dam, reservoir and other infrastructure so that they can give necessary feedback.”The government has already awarded the contract to conduct the feasibility and ESIA studies to a Nepal-China joint venture company. The JV has two Nepali firms — SIDRI Co and ERMC — and China Three Gorges as partners.Uddab Raj Chaulagain, managing director of ERMC, said they are conducting the feasibility study as per the detailed engineering format. “After we submit the report to the government, only project design works will remain and the government can simultaneously prepare the detailed engineering design and work on the investment modality.”According to him, at present, they are awaiting some strategic policy related issues from the government for the final design works.A study report prepared by Japan International Cooperation Agency in 1985 had suggested to build the project under the public-private-partnership model. It had also mentioned that the project development cost of Sunkoshi III would hover around $582 million. However, the exact cost can be ascertained only after the detailed design is finalised. Meanwhile, the Sunkoshi II project is expected to cost $1.02 billion.Earlier, Investment Board Nepal had showcased both the projects in the third Nepal Investment Summit on March 29-30 in Kathmandu.Moreover, in June last year, the government had kept the two projects in top priority for discussions during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s state visit to China. At that time, the government had proposed to the Chinese government to include both the projects in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). However, the Chinese government has not yet decided on whether to keep the projects in BRI.Meanwhile, as per officials from energy ministry, the Chinese government has given a hint that the projects could be included in BRI, so preparatory works have been expedited. ","['today', '1985', 'July next year', 'March 29-30', 'June last year', '15 days']","['China', 'Kathmandu', 'Kavre', 'Nepal', 'Sindhuli', 'Sindhupalchowk']","['Sunkoshi III', 'Investment Board Nepal', 'Japan International Cooperation Agency', 'BRI', 'ESIA', 'China Three Gorges', 'the Department of Electricity Development', 'Uddab Raj Chaulagain', 'Nepal Investment Summit', 'DED', 'ERMC', 'Sunkoshi II']","['Nabin Raj Singh', 'KP Sharma Oli’s', 'BRI']",thehimalayantimes

The Chinese government has also committed to organise the ‘Ninth China Festival’ and the ‘Fourth Kathmandu Cultural Forum’ in Nepal.“The commitment of the Chinese government will positively impact the development of country’s tourism sector,” said Khum Bahadur Subedi, president of TAAN.As China is second largest tourism market for Nepal, the recent visit of President Xi will encourage more Chinese tourists to travel to Nepal, he added. According to him, almost 70 per cent of Chinese tourists visit Nepal for trekking, hiking and other adventurous activities. Since most of them come for trekking, the average length of stay of Chinese tourists is also comparatively longer than tourists coming from other countries.“Trekking entrepreneurs believe that this new chapter in Nepal-China cooperation will contribute in generating jobs, improving livelihoods and promoting Nepal as a top tourist destination for Chinese and international tourists,” he added.According to the Department of Immigration, a total of 153,602 Chinese tourists visited Nepal in 2018, while the country has received 106,050 visitors from China in the first eight months of this year. ","['2018', 'two-day', 'today', 'the first eight months of this year']","['China', 'Nepal']","['TAAN', 'Trekking Agencies’ Association of Nepal', 'the Department of Immigration', 'the ‘Fourth Kathmandu Cultural Forum’']","['Xi', 'Nepal', 'Xi Jinping', 'Khum Bahadur Subedi']",thehimalayantimes
https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/rjp-n-sp-n-unity-imperative-to-create-alternative-force,"RJP-N, SP-N unity imperative to create alternative force",2019-10-14 12:15,"Your party has been holding unity talks with Samajwadi Party-Nepal for the last few months. What’s the progress so far?There is need to create a broad political platform to champion the cause of identity andempowerment of marginalised communities and groups.In the second Constituent Assembly, there were seven Madhesi parties, including the erstwhile Federal Socialist Forum-Nepal, who had fought for the cause of Madhes jointly. The border blockade was the ultimate consequence of the movement launched after promulgation of the constitution. People across the Madhes then asked us: Why are you fighting for the cause of Madhesis and other marginalised communities separately? Why don’t you unite and fight for your cause jointly? People’s sentiment across Madhes compelled us to think about the need for unity between Madhesi forces. We started our journey of unity by first merging five parties — Sadbhavana Party, Tarai Madhes Democratic Party, National Madhes Socialist Party, Tarai Madhes Sadbhavana Party-Nepal and Madhesi Janadhikar Forum-Republican.The Anil Kumar Jha-led Nepal Sadbhavana Party joined the unity process at the last moment when we were announcing our unity in April, 2017.  This is how six parties championing the cause of Madhesis and other marginalised communities merged. We did not make serious attempt to unify the Upendra Yadav-led Federal Socialist Forum-Nepal although we had thought of it at that time. The process of merging the six Madhesi parties accelerated after we visited Maleth of Saptari where five Madhesis were martyred during a protest. Upendra Yadav was also present with us at Maleth. We listened to the popular sentiment of Madhesi people that all Madhesi forces should unite to effectively fight for their cause. In the meantime, SP-N leaders raised the slogan of making their party a national outfit, which the RJP-N also agreed with.  In the past also, all the change seeking forces, including those that champion the cause of identity and empowerment of Madhesis and other marginalised communities, had joined hands to steer the movement for their rights.After the border blockade, we formed a broad alliance of change seeking forces in Kathmandu in an attempt to form a broad national force. In this context, I think that in order to complete that task, the RJP-N and the SP-N should merge as soon as possible. This merger should not be related to just these two parties, but all the communities, including Khas-Arya, who see the need for an inclusive Nepal. Only an inclusive Nepal can ensure peace, stability and prosperity.When will merger between the RJP-N and SP-N take place?The way the two major political parties — Nepal Communist Party (NCP) and the Nepali Congress — are trying to monopolise things in the country, there is risk Nepal will witness the rise of two-party system, which won’t be good for anybody, neither for democracy nor the country. We are a multi-lingual and multi-ethnic country that basically demands pluralism. Those who dismiss the movement of Madhesis and other marginalised communities as a caste issue, must understand that this is not a caste issue, but an issue that is at the core of identity and empowerment of marginalised communities, which cannot be swept under the carpet. Unless these issues are addressed to the satisfaction of the affected communities, they will continue to be raised.What are the key issues delaying unity between the SP-N and RJP-N?We champion the same political cause — empowerment of marginalised communities — and we have major support base in the same geographical areas. Yes there are some ideological issues where we differ, particularly on the forms of government and electoral system, but I think we should continue debating the issues without the issues impeding our efforts to unify. The SP-N wants directly elected president and fully proportional electoral system. These issues are basically related to state restructuring. At present we have the prime ministerial form of government, also known as Westminster model. This government commands almost two-thirds majority in the Parliament and yet it has failed to ensure good governance. This government has shown authoritarian tendency. As this is happening in the prime ministerial form of government, the question that arises is what will happen if we have a directly elected president. I am saying all this to highlight the need for continuous debate on ideological issues. The proportional strength of our two parties should be taken into account in relation to the question of unification. We have almost similar strength in the Parliament and we run a coalition government in Province 2.The only difference is that the SP-N has its organisation in almost 65 districts, which is slightly more than our organisational base.  Therefore, unity should be based on the basis of equality. We are for a system wherein the party will be run by a single leader but decisions will be taken by majority of office bearers. Our model of presidium did not work and we should avoid it in the unified party.When will unity take place?As both our parties have set the date for their general conventions, I think, It will be good to unify before the general convention so that we can hold our unity convention soon. Even if unity does not happen soon, we are ready to hold our general convention on the stipulated date and continue our efforts to merge our parties. One event should not affect the other. Although I cannot give you the exact date when our two parties will unite, I can say the merger will not take long given the  kind of seriousness with which both parties are holding unity talks.Two members of RJP-N, Anil Kumar Jha and Rajkishor Yadav don’t  support unity. What do you have to say?A few months ago, our party made two official decisions — to hold the party’s general convention and to hold talks for unity or alliance with SP-N. What we are doing is as per the party’s official decision. No member of the party has the right to go against the party’s decisions.Both the RJP-N and SP-N are trying to create an alternative force but will it be possible? How can you challenge the NCP and NC, which have strong political base across the country?If we talk about the strength of these two parties, then you should also remember these were the only two parties that ran the country after restoration of democracy in 1990 but what happened in the subsequent years when they failed to address people’s grievances? The Constituent Assembly was formed to address people’s genuine demands. The republican order, inclusion and federalism were neither the agenda of the NC nor the erstwhile CPN-UML. But multiple forces steered movements raising these issues in the last 20 years. These two parties have not been able to digest these issues and the Maoist party that raised these issues during conflict abandoned these issues. These issues can create fresh problems if the major parties fail to address them. Let’s not forget that there was no opposition party in the Panchayat era, but that system could not last long. My view is that if the genuine grievances of marginalised communities are not addressed properly, then their dissatisfaction can pose challenge to the country’s existence. Therefore, it’s our responsibility to address the demands of all communities and groups.There was an attempt in the past to portray the grievances of Madhesis and other marginalised communities as regional and caste issues but now people know they are national issues and not an agenda of any specific community, class, community or region.While it is true that we were elected under the new constitution, it is also true that the constitution has not been fully accepted by all. The NCP and NC are trying to suppress the agenda of marginalised communities on the basis of their parliamentary strength. The reality is that the more you try to suppress something, the more problematic it becomes.How do you evaluate the government’s performance thus far?Some people have wrong notion about us but they should know we do not oppose the fundamental features of the constitution. Republican order, federalism, proportional inclusion — the basic features of the new constitution — are basically our agenda. Our position is that articles of the constitution should conform with the spirit and directive principles of the constitution. The constitution says we are a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, multi-lingual and multi-religious country. Therefore, the constitution should promote and protect these identities.Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had signed a document with us admitting that there was need to amend the constitution following which we extended support to Oli during the prime ministerial election. The PM signed similar agreement with the SP-N and therefore, the SP-N continues to be a partner in the government hoping that the constitution will be amended. In the pursuit of implementation of the constitution, the government failed to win the confidence of the NC, whose support was crucial to frame the new constitution. The government that won almost two-thirds majority failed to understand the message of the electorate that it should be ready to amend the constitution to expand its acceptability. People, who want the constitution to be amended, have sent their representatives to the Parliament and now they are raising their voice in the House.The government gave the slogan of economic development and prosperity but failed to win the confidence of the people. When the government talks of achieving the goals of prosperity, we should understand that it must build conducive environment for the same. The government gave slogan of zero tolerance of corruption. It said it would bring prosperity. The government gave unrealistic slogan of railway connectivity with China. It also said it would run ships in our rivers. People got tempted by these slogans, but the government could not realise those goals because they were not realistic. On the other hand, the government’s actions were against its promises. Big corruption scandals, including wide body aircraft scandal and the 4 G corruption scandal have tainted its image. The Nirmala rape and murder and other cases of sexual violence are evidences of how bad the security situation is. The government failed in all these things and as a result our party which had extended outside support to the government withdrew it.SP-N is also threatening to quit the government if the constitution is not amended. I hope the government mends its ways soon. Our country is badly affected by conflict and cannot afford another uncertainty or conflict. Our party wants to take part in all efforts to build the country if the government builds the environment for the same. We are a responsible force seeking resolution to our problems in a democratic manner. We do not want to create anarchy. A democratic government responds to all demands raised by democratic forces in a democratic manner. But this government appears to be working with authoritarian mindset. It wants to bring all key agencies, including National Investigation Department and Department of Revenue Investigation and Department of Money Laundering Investigation under the Prime Minister’s Office.  This has created terror in the minds of the public. The government does not seem to trust its own institutions. The PM signed agreement with ministers seeking their pledge for better performance, which is against the principle of governance. In all democratic countries, the higher authorities delegate powers and do not seek more powers, but here things are different. If a secretary errs, isn’t the minister morally responsible for poor performance? The government is making mockery of its operation rules.The government’s handling of foreign policy has been criticised by experts. What is your view?I have seen comments on the government’s handling of Indo-pacific Strategy and China’s Belt and Road Initiative.I remember a song of Narayan Gopal which gives the message that if you want to appease everybody, you will end up losing the confidence of all. You cannot satisfy everybody. We must clearly say what our interests are without worrying about somebody becoming unhappy. The government is gradually losing foreign communities’ confidence. We should be able to stay as trusted friend of both our neighbours — India and China — without tilting towards any neighbour or without playing a neighbour against another. Ninety per cent of our transaction takes place with India due to our geographical uniqueness. I am for promoting connectivity with China, but not at the cost of others. We want to be self-reliant, but we cannot be independent by substituting dependency. We should not be part of conflicts between big powers. We should be friendly with all countries but that does not mean we should appease all because that’s not possible. Unfortunately, this situation exists in our country now. ","['the subsequent years', 'the last few months', 'April, 2017', 'the last 20 years', '1990']","['NC', 'China', 'India', 'Province', 'Madhesi', 'Kathmandu']","['the Maoist party', 'House', 'The Constituent Assembly', 'Madhes', 'Madhesi Janadhikar Forum-Republican', 'Parliament', 'the Upendra Yadav-led', 'National Investigation Department', 'Sadbhavana Party', 'SP-N', 'Nepal Communist Party', 'Tarai Madhes Democratic Party', 'RJP-N', 'Constituent Assembly', 'Indo-pacific Strategy', 'CPN-UML', 'the Nepali Congress', 'RJP-N?We', 'NCP', 'Samajwadi Party-Nepal', 'Department of Revenue Investigation and Department of Money Laundering Investigation', 'Panchayat', 'National Madhes Socialist Party', 'Federal Socialist Forum-Nepal']","['KP Sharma Oli', 'Maleth', 'The Anil Kumar Jha-led Nepal Sadbhavana Party', 'Upendra Yadav', 'Nepal', 'Westminster', 'Madhes', 'Maleth of Saptari', 'Nirmala', 'Narayan Gopal', 'Tarai Madhes Sadbhavana Party-Nepal', 'Anil Kumar Jha']",thehimalayantimes
https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-landmark-visit-2,Editorial: Landmark visit,2019-10-14 08:45,"Chinese President Xi Jinping, who paid a two-day state visit to Nepal at the invitation of President Bidhya Devi Bhandari, has said Nepal will no longer remain ‘land-locked’, but will become a ‘land-linked’ country through better connectivity network with the northern neighbour. He is the first Chinese president to visit Nepal after a hiatus of 23 years. The last Chinese president to visit Nepal was Jiang Zemin, in December 1996. Under the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMCN), which is the Nepali version of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), of which Nepal is a member, President Xi said feasibility study of the trans-Himalayan railway would start shortly. China will also be supporting the construction of a tunnel road and upgrading the Araniko Highway, which was shut down after the devastating 2015 earthquake. Other roads linking Nepal with China’s Tibet will also be upgraded. According to officials from both the sides, all the Chinese-funded projects will be coordinated under the THMCN. Nepal has so far not been able to reap benefits from the seven Chinese ports (three land ports and four seaports) and the protocol to the transit and transport agreement due to the poor condition of roads in Nepal.At the end of Xi’s visit, both the countries signed as many as 20 agreements to further enhance the bilateral relations that have remained cordial since both sides established diplomatic relations in 1955. The list of agreements include, among others, boundary management system; MoU on cooperation on governance capacity building; treaty on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters; MoU on Sagarmatha protection cooperation; MoU on promoting key projects of investment and cooperation on productive capacity; MoU on feasibility study of China-Nepal cross-border railway project; MoU regarding cooperation in disaster risk reduction and emergency response; protocol for the export of citrus fruits from Nepal; MoU on the establishment of a joint working group of trade; MoU on the establishment of an investment cooperation working group; and MoU on tunnels’ construction cooperation.President Xi’s visit has helped cement the age-old and problem-free ties between the two countries. Better connectivity with China is expected to boost Nepal’s trade with China and East Asia. Xi’s visit is a landmark in that China has expressed firm commitment to help Nepal become a land-linked country. The hearty welcome accorded to President Xi by both the Nepal government and the Nepali people is an affirmation of our goodwill for China and its people and Nepal’s unequivocal support of the one-China policy that has remained unchanged despite changes in the political system in the country. With China showing great commitment to our development endeavours, it is only right that we do regular follow-up on the agreements reached between the two countries. At his banquet speech on Saturday, President Xi drew Nepal’s attention towards timely implementation of the projects identified by both the sides. We must take his statement seriously. His pledge to upgrade Nepal’s northern entry points to develop multi-connectivity shows just how much importance China attaches to Nepal.Preventable mishapsWith millions of people travelling on roads that are in poor condition during festival time, an accident is inevitable, especially when a poorly maintained vehicle is also carrying passengers beyond its capacity. A major bus accident in Sindhupalchowk to the northeast of Kathmandu Friday morning took the lives of 11 people and left 101 injured when the bus turned turtle. The bus had fallen 60 metres from the road after the brakes failed. The first thing that comes to mind is, how could a bus with a seating capacity for 40 or 50 be carrying 113 passengers, with more than half of them on the rooftop?The accident could have been largely prevented, or at least fewer people would have suffered in the incident were it not for the greed of the bus driver. There is a tendency to cram as many passengers as possible in vehicles, especially during festival time, taking advantage of the hapless people who must reach their destination on time. A little vigilance by the traffic police on the highways could go a long way in preventing such accidents caused by overloading. With so many accidents taking place on the roads year after year, travelling is becoming a nightmare in Nepal.","['year', '2015', 'the roads year', '23 years', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'two-day', 'December 1996', '1955']","['China', 'Kathmandu', 'Nepal', 'Sindhupalchowk', 'Tibet']","['THMCN', 'the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network', 'Sagarmatha']","['BRI', 'Nepal', 'Jiang Zemin', 'Xi Jinping', 'Bidhya Devi Bhandari', 'Xi']",thehimalayantimes

He said BRI assistance could prove crucial in realising Nepal’s target of graduating to a middle-income country by 2030.“We believe BRI is a reliable and result-oriented platform for cooperation,” Gyawali said at the Fourth International Conference on Belt and Road for Development and Prosperity of South Asia organised in Kathmandu.On the occasion, Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Hou Yanqi said BRI was a platform for all participants, and added that could help boost economic and social development in the South Asian region. ",['today'],"['China', 'Nepal', 'Kathmandu', 'Nepal Hou Yanqi']",,"['Kumar Gyawali', 'Gyawali', 'BRI']",thehimalayantimes

https://thehimalayantimes.com/news-archives/pakistani-women-sold-in-marriage-then-prostitution-in-china,"Pakistani women sold in marriage, then prostitution in China",2019-06-17 18:36,"FAISALABAD: At first, in her desperate calls home to her mother in Pakistan, Natasha Masih couldn’t bring herself to say what they were doing to her.All the 19-year-old would say was that her new husband — a Chinese man her family sold her off to in marriage — was torturing her. Eventually she broke down and told her mother the full story, pleading with her to bring her home.The husband had hidden her away in a hotel in a remote corner of China and for the past weeks had been forcing her to have sex with other men.“I bought you in Pakistan,” she said her husband told her. “You belong to me. You are my property.”Her mother turned to the only people she knew who could help, her small evangelical church in a run-down slum of the Pakistani city of Faisalabad. There, a group of parishioners began putting together an elaborate plan to rescue the girl from the hotel more than 1,100 miles away.Natasha was one of hundreds of Pakistani girls who have been married off to Chinese men in return for cash payments to their families, most of them Christians, a community that is among the poorest of the poor in the country.The Associated Press reported previously how Christian pastors and Pakistani and Chinese brokers work together in a lucrative trade, aggressively pursuing Pakistani girls who are tricked into fraudulent marriages and find themselves trapped in China with sometimes abusive husbands.Since then, police investigations have uncovered that many of the women are forced into prostitution in China. A picture of the extent of the trafficking networks has emerged from a series of arrests and raids in recent weeks by Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency, as well as testimony from victims, many of whom were previously too frightened to come forward.The AP spoke to seven girls who had been forced into prostitution — four of them still in China.Families are told their daughters will be wed to well-off businessmen and given good lives in China, and the marriage trade is depicted as a benefit for all sides — impoverished parents receive money, while Chinese men find brides in a country where men outnumber women. But investigators are increasingly convinced that the majority of the girls are sold into prostitution, two law enforcement officials familiar with the investigations told the AP.“The girls who are interviewed say they were tortured” — using a euphemism for rape and forced prostitution, said one of the officials. “They are afraid for their families and for the disgust they fear they will feel. ... Make no mistake, this is trafficking.”However, even as investigators are uncovering the scope of the trade, the Pakistani government has sought to keep it quiet. Senior government officials have ordered investigators to remain silent about the trafficking because they don’t want to jeopardize Pakistan’s increasingly close economic relationship with China, the two officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity for that reason.Beijing is investing billions of dollars in Pakistan as part of its Belt and Road Initiative, a global endeavor aimed at reconstituting the Silk Road and linking China to all corners of Asia. Under a $75 billion project known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, Beijing has promised a sprawling package of infrastructure development, from road construction and power plants to agriculture.The largest component is a 3,200-kilometer (2,000-mile) road linking China to Pakistan’s deep-water port of Gwadar on the Arabian Sea.In Pakistan, it has been billed as a massive development program that will bring new prosperity to the South Asian nation, where the average citizen lives on just $125 a month. Since 2015, thousands of Chinese have arrived in Pakistan to work on a multitude of projects.China’s ambassador to Pakistan has gone on local television channels denying girls are trafficked to China and sold into prostitution. The issue of human trafficking was not discussed during a visit to Pakistan this month by China’s vice president, Wang Qishan, who held talks with Prime Minister Imran Khan and Pakistan’s president.In comments carried in the Pakistani press, Wang denied trafficking was taking place — and referred to an online video that traffickers often use to lure in families, showing Pakistani brides in China dancing and happy.“China is denying it is happening, but we are showing the proof,” said Saleem Iqbal, an activist in Pakistan’s small Christian minority who has helped bring girls back from China and collects evidence of trafficking networks that he provides to police.The AP spoke by messaging app with Arooj, a Pakistani girl still trapped in China. She said her husband beat her and would come home drunk with friends and force her to have sex with them. Like many of the girls, she wasn’t sure where she was in China; often they are taken from Beijing on flights elsewhere in the country, then driven for hours to small towns, without being told the destination.Ijaz Alam Augustine, the human rights and minorities minister in Pakistan’s Punjab province, estimated that more than 500 women have been trafficked to China, while Iqbal put the figure at 750 to 1,000.In early May, Pakistani police swept through posh neighborhoods in the Punjab provincial capital of Lahore and in the national capital, Islamabad. They arrested Chinese nationals and their Pakistani partners involved in two marriage-broker networks that sought out Pakistani girls for Chinese grooms. They all now face trafficking charges.Investigators have since made further arrests in smaller Punjab towns and in the western city of Peshawar, rolling up more networks. Overall, at least two dozen Chinese and dozens of Pakistanis have been arrested.The two law enforcement officials said the Lahore-based network had been operating for at least a year. The network was protected by corrupt policemen, and the son of a former senior police official served as the lynchpin between the Chinese and Pakistani operatives, the officials said.The network also benefited from lax oversight by authorities, they said. For example, at least five of the Chinese traffickers were able to enter Pakistan on business visas based on companies that didn’t exist.The AP saw one of the charge sheets from the wave of arrests, in which eight Chinese nationals and five Pakistanis were charged with human trafficking. It also accused the traffickers of profiting on body parts stolen from girls trafficked to China, without offering evidence.Other police reports tell of a Pakistani pastor who signed dozens of empty marriage certificates, which were later filled out by traffickers once they had acquired a prospective bride.Investigators have conducted dozens of interviews in recent weeks with trafficked girls and women, who are increasingly speaking out.One woman, Sumaira, who was sold to a Chinese groom by her brothers, told the AP she had remained silent for months after escaping her husband, even refusing to talk to investigators. But now she is coming forward.“If I had told everything that happened to me then, maybe I would have saved so many other Pakistani girls,” she said. “But I was too afraid, too afraid of my brothers. Now I want the people that did this to me to not do it to other girls.”The 30-year-old Sumaira had been running a small beauty salon in a poor, mostly Christian neighborhood of the Punjab town of Gujranwala. “I was a very different person than what you see now,” she said. “Then I had hope. I believed in my future. Now I don’t know.”Her brothers forced her to marry in July last year after being offered money by brokers. Her husband took her first to a house in Islamabad, where she said she was kept for a week, raped every night by Chinese men.Before leaving for China, she convinced her husband to let her go home to say farewell to her sisters.“When I got home, I yelled at my brothers, ‘Why did you sell me? How much money did you get for me?’” she said. The brothers beat her, but she managed to escape to the home of an uncle.Natasha Masih lives in Wasirpura, a mainly Christian district of Faisalabad where many work as domestic workers. She didn’t want to marry, but “what could I do, my family is poor.” A friend of her father suggested he marry her to a Chinese man. She said her father struggled with the decision but needed the money.He had four other daughters and could no longer work after hurting his back. Natasha said refusing was never an option.In November, her husband took her to China’s remote northwestern region. She was driven to a forested area and a small house with no kitchen or bathroom that she was told would be her home. She discovered that three male and two female friends of her husband shared the house. Soon, her husband began to force her to have sex with the men.Soon after, her husband took her to the Yin Du luxury hotel in the nearby city of Urumqi. There, he confined her to a room and sold her into prostitution.“Always two or three men were the same, and then he would bring other men, ordering me to have sex with them,” she said. “I was living in hell-like conditions, silently weeping, silently praying for help.” She made furtive calls to her parents on her mobile phone.Back in Faisalabad, a member of her parent’s church, Farooq Masih, formed a group of men from the congregation to try to help. Masih, who is not related to Natasha, told the AP they struggled with how to free Natasha until one among them told of his younger brother who was a student in China. The brother agreed to contact Natasha’s husband, pose as a client and pay him to sleep with her to get access to her.The student texted Natasha and told her he was coming to rescue her, asking for details of when her husband comes and goes from the hotel. Finally, the day came. He called her and told her to slip outside the hotel to where he was waiting in a taxi.“I saw him and quickly I took my clothes and got into his taxi,” she said. “I didn’t ask his name. I didn’t ask anything, I just said, ‘Brother, thank you.’” Soon she was on a plane to Pakistan.Farooq Masih and the other men from the church have since dedicated hours to unearthing trafficking networks. They recently conducted their own sting operation in Faisalabad, orchestrating a fake marriage to a prospective Chinese groom that led the Federal Investigation Agency to the Chinese and Pakistani brokers and the pastor who solemnized the unions for a fee.Meanwhile, Natasha — who turned 20 last week — helps other young women open up about their experiences and encourages them to talk to investigators. She has heard reports that her husband was back in Pakistan looking for another girl to marry.“I am lucky,” Natasha said. “Many girls who were taken there by their husbands are still living a terrible life. ... Now I know what is freedom and what is slavery. In China, I was treated as a slave by my husband.” ","['months', 'at least a year', '20 last week', '2015', 'a week', 'the past weeks', 'November', 'this month', '30-year-old', 'July last year', '19-year-old', '750 to 1,000.In early May', 'recent weeks']","['Masih', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Islamabad', 'Gujranwala', 'Lahore', 'Faisalabad', 'Urumqi', 'Wasirpura', 'Peshawar', 'Pakistan']","['AP', 'Natasha', 'the Federal Investigation Agency', 'The Associated Press', 'Federal Investigation Agency', 'Wang']","['Saleem Iqbal', 'Wang Qishan', 'Natasha', 'Yin Du', 'Imran Khan', 'Sumaira', 'Arooj', 'Alam Augustine', 'Iqbal', 'Natasha Masih', 'Farooq Masih']",thehimalayantimes
https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-ports-for-trade,EDITORIAL: Ports for trade,2019-04-11 08:58,"Nepal and China are all set to sign the protocol of the Nepal-China Transit Transport Agreement (TTA) during President Bidhya Devi Bhandari’s upcoming visit to China, where she is scheduled to attend the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation (BRFIC). President Bhandari is paying her first ever official visit to the northern neighbour at the invitation of her Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on April 24. The protocol of the TTA will be signed and exchanged between Secretary at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies Kedar Bahadur Adhikari and Chinese vice-minister on behalf of their respective governments in the presence of Presidents Bhandari and Xi. Nepal and China initialled the protocol on the TTA in Kathmandu on September 7 last year. Earlier, Nepal and China had agreed on the transit transport agreement during PM KP Sharma Oli’s visit to China in March 2016. Both the governments have already endorsed the protocol on the TTA for formal signing. Both the sides had also agreed to formally sign the protocol during a high-level visit from one of the two countries.The protocol on the TTA holds significance for Nepal as it allows the landlocked country to use four seaports, namely Shenzen, Lianyungang, Zhanjiang and Tianjin and three dry ports at Lanzhou, Lhasa and Xigatse, where China has already built a railway line. These ports will end Nepal’s sole dependency on the Indian ports for overseas trade. Once the TTA comes into operation, Nepal will be land-linked with the world’s second biggest economy as she can use either rail or road to access the designated seaports for third-country trade. The government will soon endorse President Bhandari’s visit and its agenda. She is scheduled to leave for China on April 24 and address the Forum on April 25. She will meet her Chinese counterpart and extend him a formal invitation to visit Nepal. Xi is likely to pay the first ever official visit to Nepal shortly after Bhandari’s visit to Beijing. No high-level visit has been made from the Chinese side since Premier Wen Jiabao visited Nepal in January 2012.After the protocol on the TTA is signed, Nepal will be free to use the Chinese seaports and dry ports, which should give a boost to Nepal’s economy, for third country trade as far away as Europe, Russia, Japan and Korea. The electronic tracking system, which is now being used for Nepal-bound cargo from Indian ports, can also be used for shipments from Chinese seaports to make third country trade hassle-free. The Nepali business community must learn to utilise these ports to the maximum possible, not only for import of goods but also for export to other countries. However, before this can be done, the Nepal government must quickly upgrade the 82-km-long road from Galchhi to Syphrubesi, Rasuwa to utilise the Chinese ports. With the right policy in place, Nepal can also attract more Chinese investment to produce goods at competitive prices for export. This way, containers entering Nepal loaded with imported goods will not have to return empty. With China ready to link Nepal with a railway line in the near future under the Belt and Road Initiative, the TTA will be a milestone in enhancing trade with countries of the Far East and Europe.School for allIt’s been quite a few years since the government has been launching the school enrollment drive in different parts of the country just before the start of the new session, and with considerable success. Quite unlike many countries, the government (at different levels), political parties, religious organisations and the people at large stand together when it comes to giving an education to children. But even then, quite a large number of children of school-going age are not in school, which means something is wrong. Even in the Kathmandu metropolis, 3 per cent of children aged between 5 and 10 are out of school. The situation could be worse in the remote districts.Once enrolled, retaining children until they complete secondary school has been even more challenging. So it is necessary that the stakeholders look into the different reasons that are keeping children away from school. Maybe incentives to the children and their parents and more facilities in the school will help enroll more children and also retain them. They could range from mid-day meals to having separate toilets for girls. Whatever one does, it all boils down to allocating more resources to education. ","['April 25', 'mid-day', 'between 5 and 10', 'January 2012.After', 'a few years', 'September 7 last year', 'April 24', 'March 2016']","['China', 'Beijing', 'Shenzen', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'Nepal', 'Lanzhou', 'Tianjin', 'Zhanjiang', 'Lhasa', 'Lianyungang', 'Russia', 'Xigatse', 'KP', 'Kathmandu']","['the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies Kedar Bahadur Adhikari', 'Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation', 'TTA', 'the Belt and Road Initiative']","['Nepal', 'Xi Jinping', 'Bhandari', 'Bidhya Devi Bhandari', 'Xi', 'Syphrubesi', 'Wen Jiabao']",thehimalayantimes

https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/g-7-ministers-reveal-clear-differences-on-middle-east,G-7 ministers reveal �clear differences� on Middle East,2019-04-07 09:24,"DINARD: Foreign ministers from the Group of Seven nations failed to reach consensus on key Middle East issues on Saturday as they wrapped up a meeting in France that was shaken by the absence of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.The diplomats in attendance projected a united front while walking side-by-side along a seaside promenade before they released the agreement from their two-day meeting in Dinard. The agreement included mildly worded joint commitments on issues such as fighting cybercrime, giving women bigger peacemaking roles, and engaging with countries in Africa’s Sahel region to combat migrant trafficking.But what was omitted from the G-7′s positions said as much as what was included. The differences could set the stage for tensions at an August summit of the leaders of the G-7 advanced economies — the United States, France, Canada, Japan, Germany, Italy and the UK.A European Union official expressed “regret” the document had what she considered to be several glaring omissions that conflicted with non-negotiable positions of the EU. They included “no reference to a two-state solution” in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and “no mention” of the UN Security Council resolution in favor of the Iran nuclear deal, she said.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she was not allowed to speak to the news media, said the language used to described the G-7′s deep concern over Iran’s “continuing support for terrorist organizations and armed militias” was not language EU members tend to use. Four of the G-7 nations are in the European Union.The foreign ministers’ joint statement itself acknowledged “clear differences” on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict after “an exchange of views.”The agreement included an initiative to help countries share best practices on encouraging responsible online behavior. Also, the group pledged to encourage the creation of funds to help survivors of sexual violence in danger spots, and to encourage Sahel countries to take steps to end trafficking. It also reaffirmed the G-7′s “commitment to a rules-based international order.”Discord is becoming a theme for the group.Last June, US President Donald Trump roiled the G-7 meeting in Canada by first agreeing to a group statement on trade, then withdrawing support from it and sending a string of negative tweets about the summit and its host, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.On Saturday in Dinard, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was missing from the final group photo after attending Friday’s session. Combined with Pompeo’s absence, Hunt’s status raised questions about the G-7′s relevance.US officials acknowledged points of discord at the talks hosted by French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.US Deputy Secretary of State John J Sullivan, who went in Pompeo’s place, said Washington would use the G-7 forum to galvanize support for Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, whose claim to the presidency is backed by the US and about 50 other countries.But the meeting failed to change the position of Italy, the sole G-7 member state not to back Guaido.“We spoke about it. The Italian position on Venezuela is pretty clear,” said Italian Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero. “It is an extremely difficult situation, especially in light of the humanitarian emergency that weighs the most in in our hearts.”Guaido has set out to topple the socialist administration of President Nicolas Maduro amid deepening unrest in the country, which has been plagued by nearly a month of power outages.Italy also has irked EU and US allies by becoming the first G-7 member to sign up to a Chinese plan to build a Silk Road-style global trade network, the Belt and Road Initiative.Any reference to the contentious trillion-dollar plan was missing in Saturday’s texts. ","['Last\xa0June', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'nearly a month', 'two-day', 'August']","['Germany', 'Canada', 'US', 'France', 'Japan', 'Iran', 'Italy', 'Washington', 'Dinard', 'Venezuela', 'the United States']","['G-7', 'the European Union', 'the UK.A', 'the G-7', 'Group of Seven', 'European Union', 'the G-7 nations', 'EU', 'the UN Security Council', 'State']","['Jeremy Hunt', 'Pompeo', 'Jean-Yves Le Drian', 'Nicolas Maduro', 'Enzo Moavero', 'Donald Trump', 'Dinard', 'Mike Pompeo', 'Sahel', 'John J Sullivan', 'Juan Guaido', 'Justin Trudeau', 'Guaido', 'Hunt']",thehimalayantimes

Manufacturing is mostly in China. The government needs to stop the production of it,"" she said.In online Chinese forums, customers can buy everything from African rhino horn to live young pangolins, also known as scaly anteaters, and the powdered horn of saiga, an endangered type of antelope found in Europe and Asia.While the use of rhino horn is officially banned in China, pangolin and saiga products are legally used in Chinese medicine with the big traditional medicine companies all producing them.Companies including Kangmei Pharmaceutical and Tong Ren Tang have been given permits by local government bodies to produce medicines with pangolin scales and saiga horns, according to corporate filings.Gui Zhen Tang, which owns the biggest moon bear breeding centre in southern China, has permits for extracting bear bile, according to its website.China Traditional Medicine Holdings last year acquired Beijing Huamiao, a company it says holds permits for the ""processed products of some of the endangered and protected wild animals”. It did not elaborate.None of the companies responded to multiple requests for comment.China's State Forestry and Grassland Administration and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine did not respond to requests to comment.Hong Kong's Health Department said the city's Chinese Medicines Board ""has always been concerned about the balance between the protection of endangered species and the use of traditional Chinese medicine,"" and it would continue to observe international regulatory trends and monitor the issue with regard to endangered species.Farming of animals used in traditional medicine has been advocated by China's Forestry administration and some breeders as a sustainable way to use endangered animals in traditional Chinese medicine.However, activists say the use of farmed supplies of animals such as tigers and rhinos risks enabling the laundering of wild animal parts.Many treatments have already substituted herbal products for animal parts, and practitioners say herbal alternatives are just as, if not more effective.Lixing Lao, director at the School of Chinese Medicine at the University of Hong Kong, said there was no need to use endangered species.""Chinese medicine is part of the world,"" Lao said.

The bulk of foreign trade is routed through Raxaul.  But China has in recent years been more active in projects in a country  India has long seen as in its sphere of influence. At the same time, Nepal is seeking to reduce its dependence on India by increasing road and rail connectivity with China for access to its ports.  Mahaseth said Nepal was using the standard gauge for an East-West railway link it is building parallel to a 1,030 km highway running through the plains.Nepali and Chinese railway experts are due to meet in Beijing in May to discuss construction of the 70 km link connecting Gyiron in  Tibet with Kathmandu, making it one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects in the Himalayan mountains.“Preparation of a detailed project report for the railway line and its funding modalities will be discussed,” Mahaseth said.  The proposed railway line will be part of China’s Belt and Road initiative, which aims to link China by sea and land with southeast and central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.","['today', 'March 5Nepal', 'recent years', 'May', 'Last year']","['China', 'Beijing', 'India', 'Nepal', 'Kathmandu', 'Tibet']","['Gyiron', 'Pokhara', 'Reuters', 'Physical Infrastructure and Transport Raghubir Mahaseth', 'Standard']","['Raxaul', 'Nepal', 'Mahaseth', 'Nepali', 'Buddha', 'mm', 'Lumbini']",thehimalayantimes

It attempts to interfere in the friendly cooperation between China and Nepal which is very ridiculous,” read the embassy statement.The embassy said they hoped the US could do more practical things for developing countries instead of making indiscreet remarks or criticisms.The embassy said China shared the feelings of developing countries having faced the same problems such as insufficient industrial capacity, lack of self-reliant development capability, backward infrastructure and financial difficulties over quite a long time.“So we know their pressing needs and have conducted mutually beneficial cooperation with these countries under the principle of upholding justice while pursuing shared interests and provided assistance much needed by developing countries with no political strings attached based on our own experience,” read the statement. ","['today', 'yesterday', 'February 26A day']","['China', 'Nepal', 'US', 'Kathmandu']","['the Embassy of China', 'Defence for South and Southeast Asia Joe Felter', 'NepalKathmandu', 'BRI']",['BRI'],thehimalayantimes

We want independent, prosperous and security-independent Nepal. That’s our interest. That’s your interest. That’s our shared interest,” he said.According to Felter, the Indo-Pacific Strategy provides strategic context to decades-long military cooperation between Nepal and the US. “I think it is a recognition that we have shared interests and shared vision for the future of the region. It recognises maintenance of rules-based order where interests and sovereignty of all countries, large and small, are protected,” he said.Under the Indo-Pacific Strategy, the US focuses on working with partners across the region to build their capacity to ensure that their interests are not undermined by any power and that they are protected in a rules-based order by international law, according to Felter.When asked whether the Indo-Pacific Strategy, as interpreted by some observers, was to counter China’s growing clout in the region, Felter said it was in the interest of all to develop constructive relationship with China. He added that some activities associated with Chinese-led Belt and Road Initiative were very much in China’s interest, and not necessarily in the interest of countries associated.“We welcome a constructive relationship with China. We welcome investment by China as long as that investment is designed to serve the interest of Nepal and not just China,” he said. “We hope China would improve its transparency and the quality of its investments and ensure that its activities are aimed at serving interests of countries like Nepal.”Felter held meetings with Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, Defence Minister Ishwar Pokhrel, Nepali Army CoAS General Purna Chandra Thapa, Foreign Secretary Shanker Das Bairagi and Defence Secretary Reshmi Raj Pandey.He said discussions were focused on military-to-military cooperation, defence cooperation opportunities, civil and military best practices and military professionalisation opportunities.“As a good partner, we’ve not come here to tell Nepal what we need, but to ask Nepal what it needs and work together to address those needs,” he said. “The purpose of this visit is cooperation based on mutual interest in supporting Nepal’s priorities and aspirations.”He said the US was also looking forward to partnering with Nepal in its interest in creating a national defence university. He also thanked Nepal for its extraordinary contributions to UN peacekeeping, and added that Nepali forces had well-deserved reputation for professionalism and capabilities.","['today', 'decades']","['China', 'Nepal', 'US']","['the Indo-Pacific Strategy', 'Defence', 'UN', 'Defence for South and Southeast Asia Joe Felter', 'Nepali Army CoAS']","['Felter', 'Reshmi Raj Pandey', 'Nepal', 'Purna Chandra Thapa', 'Shanker Das Bairagi', 'KP Sharma', 'Ishwar Pokhrel']",thehimalayantimes

The remittances they send back are vital for Pakistan's dollar-starved economy.Saudi Arabia has yet to comment on the Pakistani announcement of a prisoner release.The crown prince's visit marks a deepening of ties between allies whose relationship has in the past centred on oil-rich Saudi Arabia backing Pakistan's economy during difficult periods, and in return Pakistan's powerful army lending support to Saudi Arabia and its royal family.As the guardians of most holy sites in the birthplace of Islam, the Saudi royal family carries vast religious influence in Pakistan, a staunchly conservative and mostly Muslim country of 208 million people.Saudi Arabia has in recent months helped keep Pakistan's economy afloat by propping up rapidly dwindling foreign reserves with a $6 billion loan, giving it breathing room as it negotiates a bailout with the International Monetary Fund.Pakistan has shown appreciation by treating Prince Mohammed's trip as the biggest state visit since one by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2015, soon after Beijing announced plans to invest tens of billions of dollars on infrastructure in Pakistan as part of China's Belt and Road initiative.Many in the West blamed Prince Mohammed for the killing of the journalist Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October.The murder triggered the kingdom's biggest political crisis for a generation.

Unfortunately we have inherited a very difficult economic situation,"" Khan said.""Countries go in cycles. They have their high points, they have their low points. Unfortunately, our country is going through a low point at the moment with two very big deficits, a fiscal deficit and a current account deficit. And so we, as I've said, have come to learn.""Xi told Khan that he highly valued the two country's relations, reaffirming they were ""all-weather"" friends.""I attach great importance to China-Pakistan relations and am willing to work together with the prime minister to strengthen the China-Pakistan all-weather strategic partnership and build a new era of China-Pakistan destiny,"" Xi said.Neither man mentioned any economic aid in comments made in front of reporters.However, the Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, told Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi in a separate meeting that China would not let Pakistan down.""The Chinese side will continue to provide support and help to the best of its ability for Pakistan's economic and social development and national construction,"" China's Foreign Ministry cited Wang as saying, without giving details.The Pakistan prime minister's office said later that Xi had accepted an invitation to visit to the country. It gave no timeframe.Khan will meet Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Saturday, when the two countries are expected to sign a series of agreements.Though China is Pakistan's closest ally, Khan's newly elected government has sought to re-think the two countries' signature project, the $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which Beijing touts as the flagship infrastructure programme in its vast Belt and Road Initiative.Pakistan has sought to amend CPEC to put greater emphasis on projects that focus on social development, rather than purely on infrastructure.After visiting Beijing, Khan is set to be a key note speaker at a major import fair in Shanghai, an event being touted by China as an opportunity to show the world the country welcomes foreign companies and their products.Khan is in China amid unrest at home over the acquittal of a Pakistani Christian woman on death row for blasphemy, which has prompted an ultra-Islamist party to block roads in protest.","['the late 1980s', '13th', 'Last month', 'less than two months', 'two months', 'Friday', 'the start of the year', 'Saturday']","['China', 'Beijing', 'Saudi Arabia', 'BEIJING', 'Shanghai', 'Pakistan']","['Foreign Ministry', 'CPEC', 'the International Monetary Fund', 'Wang', 'State']","['Khan', 'Councillor Wang Yi', 'Xi Jinping', 'Imran Khan', 'Shah Mahmood', 'Li Keqiang', 'Xi']",thehimalayantimes

His return to power in a surprise move by current President Maithripala Sirisena has drawn concern in New Delhi that China would tighten its grip on the island that lies along busy shipping lanes.""It is advantage China at the moment,"" said Srikanth Kondappali, a specialist on India-China ties at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University who closely tracks the regional rivalry between the Asian giants.He said Beijing had invested in Rajapaksa and in his political constituency of Hambantota in the south of Sri Lanka where it has built a $1.5 billion deep water port, an airport and also planned an industrial zone.China's ambassador to Sri Lanka, Cheng Xueyuan, was among the first diplomats to meet Rajapaksa soon after he was sworn in as prime minister and he presented a congratulatory message from Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang.Sirisena sacked Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Friday and named Rajapaksa to replace him, breaking up a fragile coalition governing the island.Wickremesinghe, who was seen as pro-India, said his sacking was illegal and he has maintained that he is still prime minister and had majority support in parliament.Sri Lanka is one of a chain of countries where the India-China rivalry is playing out, stretching from Bangladesh, Nepal to the Maldives, where a pro-China leader was voted out in a surprise election result last month that was welcomed by India, the United States and the European Union.Indian diplomats were in contact with Rajapaksa's camp, officials in New Delhi said, adding they were ready to do business with the new leader so long as his appointment was in line with the country's constitution.""India will continue to extend our developmental assistance to the people of Sri Lanka,"" an Indian foreign ministry spokesman said on Monday.Separately, leaders of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological parent of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's governing Hindu nationalist-led alliance, have reached out to Rajapaksa to promote ties, party sources said.PREDATORYSeshadri Chari, an RSS leader involved in the track two diplomacy, said he was confident New Delhi and Colombo will work for better relations under the new leadership in Sri Lanka.""In the changed geo-political realities, we have to be practical and pragmatic to protect our national self-interest and do better business,"" he said. The RSS wields influence in the Modi administration and has acted as an unofficial intermediary with some neighbouring countries.China has in recent years faced criticism that many of its investments in Sri Lanka, the Maldives and other countries run the risk of driving smaller nations into debt and potentially impinge on their sovereignty.""We are seeing an international pushback against China's predatory practices. It can only intensify and in that backdrop it's hard to see Sri Lanka doling out more projects even under Rajapaksa,"" said an Indian government source.China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Beijing believes the people and government of Sri Lanka have the wisdom to ""appropriately handle"" the situation, and China hopes all sides can resolve differences via dialogue, to protect the country's stability.Harinda Vidanage, director of the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies, a thinktank in Colombo, said Sri Lanka had become a greater strategic prize after the pro-China president of the Maldives, Abdulla Yameen, lost the election.""For China, both Sri Lanka and Maldives were very important in their effort to gain a foothold in the Indian Ocean. China to certain extent lost the Maldivian connection when Yameen lost the elections,"" he said.Shailesh Kumar, Asia director at the Eurasia group, said the changes in Sri Lanka would benefit China.""While Beijing lost a pro-Chinese government earlier this month in the Maldives, it will make up ground in South Asia with the change of guard in Sri Lanka,"" he said, adding that it came as Sri Lanka's economy was in financial difficulties.""The decision to bring Rajapaksa back into the mainstream is likely intended to open the flow of Chinese funds, given the close relationship he cultivated with the Chinese leadership."" ","['earlier this month', 'recent years', 'Monday', 'Friday', 'last month']","['Maldives', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Kumar', 'Eurasia', 'New Delhi', 'India', ""Sri Lanka's"", 'Rajapaksa', 'Modi', 'the United States', ""New Delhi's"", 'Bangladesh', 'Colombo', 'Sri Lanka']","['Foreign Ministry', 'the European Union', 'Hambantota', 'RSS', 'the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies', 'Jawaharlal Nehru University', 'the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh']","['Srikanth Kondappali', 'Lu Kang', ""Narendra Modi's"", 'Sri Lanka', 'Cheng Xueyuan', 'Rajapaksa', 'Maithripala Sirisena', 'Li Keqiang', 'Harinda Vidanage', 'Yameen', 'PREDATORYSeshadri Chari', 'Ranil Wickremesinghe', 'pro-India']",thehimalayantimes

China and India have respective advantages.

Officials say there are concerns the deals were badly negotiated, too expensive or overly favoured China.But to Islamabad's frustration, Beijing is only willing to review projects that have not yet begun, three senior government officials have told Reuters.China's Foreign Ministry said, in a statement in response to questions faxed by Reuters, that both sides were committed to pressing forward with BRI projects, ""to ensure those projects that are already built operate as normal, and those which are being built proceed smoothly"".Pakistani officials say they remain committed to Chinese investment but want to push harder on price and affordability, while re-orientating the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) - for which Beijing has pledged about $60 billion in infrastructure funds - to focus on projects that deliver social development in line with Khan's election platform.China's Ambassador to Pakistan, Yao Jing, told Reuters that Beijing was open to changes proposed by the new government and ""we will definitely follow their agenda"" to work out a roadmap for BRI projects based on ""mutual consultation"".""It constitutes a process of discussion with each other about this kind of model, about this kind of roadmap for the future,"" Yao said.Beijing would only proceed with projects that Pakistan wanted, he added. ""This is Pakistan's economy, this is their society,"" Yao said.Islamabad's efforts to recalibrate CPEC are made trickier by its dependence on Chinese loans to prop up its vulnerable economy.Growing fissures in relations with Pakistan's historic ally the United States have also weakened the country's negotiating hand, as has a current account crisis likely to lead to a bailout by the International Monetary Fund, which may demand spending cuts.""We have reservations, but no other country is investing in Pakistan. What can we do?"" one Pakistani minister told Reuters.CRUMBLING RAILWAYSThe ML-1 rail line is the spine of country's dilapidated rail network, which has in recent years been edging towards collapse as passenger numbers plunge, train lines close and the vital freight business nosedives.Khan's government has vowed to make the 1,872 km (1,163 mile) line a priority CPEC project, saying it will help the poor travel across the vast South Asian nation.But Islamabad is exploring funding options for CPEC projects that depart from the traditional BRI lending model - whereby host nations take on Chinese debt to finance construction of infrastructure - and has invited Saudi Arabia and other countries to invest.One option for ML-1, according to Pakistani officials, is the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model, which would see investors or companies finance and build the project and recoup their investment from cashflows generated mainly by the rail freight business, before returning it to Pakistan in a few decades time.Yao, the Chinese envoy, said Beijing was open to BOT and would ""encourage"" its companies to invest.Rail mega-projects under China's BRI umbrella have run into problems elsewhere in Asia. A line linking Thailand and Laos has been beset by delays over financing, while Malaysia's new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad outright cancelled the Chinese-funded $20 billion East Coast Rail Link (ECRL).Beijing is happy to offer loans, but reticent to invest in the Pakistan venture as such projects are seldom profitable, according to Andrew Small, author of a book on China-Pakistan relations.""The problem is that the Chinese don't think they can make money on this project and are not keen on BOT,"" said Small.OFF-BOOKS DEBTDuring President Xi Jinping's visit to Pakistan in 2015, the ML-1 line was placed among a list of ""early harvest"" CPEC projects that would be prioritised, along with power plants urgently needed to end crippling electricity shortages.But while many other projects from that list have now been completed the rail scheme has been stuck.Pakistani officials say they became wary of how early BRI contracts were awarded to Chinese firms, and are pushing for a public tender for ML-1.Partly to help with price discovery, Pakistan asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to finance a chunk of the rail project through tendering. The ADB began discussions on a $1.5-2 billion loan, but China insisted the project was ""too strategic"", and Islamabad kicked out the ADB under pressure from Beijing in early 2017, according to Pakistani and ADB officials.""If it's such a strategic project then it should be a viable project for them to finance on very concessional terms or invest in?"" said one senior Pakistani official familiar with the project, referring to the BOT model.China's foreign ministry said Beijing was engaged in ""friendly consultations"" with Pakistan on the rail project. Chinese companies participated in BRI projects in an open and transparent way, ""pooling benefits and sharing risks"", it said.Analysts say Pakistan will struggle to attract non-Chinese investors into the project, which may force it to choose between piling on Chinese debt or walking away from the project.In 2017, Pakistan turned down Chinese funding for a $14 billion mega-dam project in the Himalayas due to cost concerns and worries Beijing could end up owning a vital national asset if Pakistan could not repay loans, as occurred with a Sri Lankan port.Khan's government chafes at several Chinese intercity mass transport projects in Punjab, the voter heartland of the previous government, which now need hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies every year.They also fume about the risk of accumulating off-books sovereign debt through power contracts, where annual profits of above 20 percent, in dollar terms, were guaranteed by the previous administration.With the ML-1 line, there are also those who harbour doubts closer to home, including the previous government's finance minister, Miftah Ismail, who said his ministry had always had concerns about its viability.""When people say it's a project of national importance, that usually means it makes no sense financially,"" he said. ","['2017', 'annual', '2015', 'recent years', 'early 2017', 'a few decades']","['Maldives', 'China', 'Beijing', 'Islamabad', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Sri Lankan', 'ML-1', 'Peshawar', 'the United States', 'Thailand', 'Laos', 'Karachi', 'Malaysia', 'Pakistan', 'Sri Lanka']","['BOT', 'Foreign Ministry', 'CPEC', 'BRI', 'the Asian Development Bank', 'Belt and Road Initiative', 'Reuters', 'the International Monetary Fund', 'ADB']","['Khusro Bakhtyar', 'Khan', 'Yao Jing', 'Mahathir Mohamad', 'BRI', 'Imran Khan', 'Small', 'Xi Jinping', 'Yao', 'Miftah Ismail', 'Andrew Small']",thehimalayantimes

State-run Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) was to have built it.But Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, seen as China-friendly, pledged to revert the project to the Chinese company if he was elected to power in last year’s elections. Oli became prime minister in February after his Nepal Communist Party scored a landslide poll victory.“Yes, the Budhi Gandaki has been given back to the Gezhouba Group,” said Roshan Khadka, an aide to Energy Minister Barsa Man Pun. “It is ... restoring the project to the Chinese company,” Khadka told Reuters. He did not give further details of the decision taken by the cabinet on Friday night.China and India are both jostling for influence in Nepal by providing aid and investment in infrastructure projects.Officials said a formal construction deal will be signed on the hydropower project after the government had negotiated the project modalities with the Chinese company. No date for this was given.Nepal’s rivers, cascading from the snow-capped Himalayas, have vast, untapped potential for hydropower generation, but lack of funds has made Nepal lean on neighbour India to meet annual power demand of 1,400 megawatts (MW).The 1,200 MW plant on Budhi Gandaki river, about 50 km (32 miles) west of Kathmandu, is meant to address acute power shortages that has marred economic growth in one of the poorest countries in the world.Critics say the project should have been open for international bidding instead of being entrusted to the Chinese company.Officials of the Chinese company were not immediately available for comment.Nepal wants the Budhi Gandaki project to be part of the Belt and Road initiative (BRI), President Xi Jinping’s landmark scheme to connect China to the rest of Asia and beyond, to which it signed up last year. ","['annual', 'February', 'last year’s', 'Friday', 'Sunday', 'last year']","['China', 'India', 'Kathmandu', 'Nepal']","['MW', 'Nepal Communist Party', 'Energy', 'Reuters', 'the Gezhouba Group', 'China Gezhouba Group Corporation', 'Nepal Electricity Authority', 'the Belt and Road', 'NEA']","['Khadka', 'KP Sharma Oli', 'BRI', 'Nepal', 'Xi Jinping', 'Roshan Khadka', 'Barsa Man Pun', 'KATHMANDU']",thehimalayantimes

Globalisation which is inclusive; globalisation which is just; and globalisation which is humane,” the PM said.The PM said Nepal and China had committed to enhance connectivity encompassing vital components including ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications within the overarching framework of trans-Himalayan multi-dimensional connectivity network.The PM said the recently finalised text of Protocol to Agreement on Transit Transport between Nepal and China would provide Nepal access to all the Chinese sea ports.“This is an important milestone towards Nepal’s transformation from a landlocked to a land-linked country,” he said.Our two countries have started discussions on various BRI related projects.The PM said regional organisations such as SAARC and BIMSTEC were also important platforms for multidimensional regional connectivity. “We must make these regional organisations fully functional and result-oriented,” he said.The PM said the government would be solely guided by national interest in selecting or accepting projects and programmes under any bilateral, regional or multilateral mechanisms.“We will not be swayed by any opinion or view that is not objective and grounded on realities,” he added.The PM said that following the consolidation of political transformation of historic proportions, Nepal was now at an important juncture of undertaking socio-economic transformation.“We believe that unprecedented economic transformation taking place in China and India offers huge opportunities for Nepal,” he said, “As a country situated between the two economic powers, Nepal cannot remain forever in the lower rung of the development ladder. We must climb the ladder, and climb at a faster pace.” ","['today', '2013']","['China', 'Nepal', 'India']","['the Master’s Programme in International Relations and Diplomacy, Tribhuvan University', 'BRI', 'the Belt and Road Initiative', 'the Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'Implications for Nepal', 'SAARC', 'BIMSTEC']","['BRI', 'Nepal', 'Xi Jinping', '“We', 'Xi', 'KP Sharma']",thehimalayantimes

Besides, some new agreements and understandings related to the Trans Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Transport Network encompassing roads, railway lines, aviation, optical fibre and some north-south corridors under the Belt and Road Initiative might also be signed.“The agreements and understandings reached in 2016 not only remind us of the glorious history of our friendship and tradition, they also reflect the need of the present time and signal our journey of tomorrow,” he said. “This visit of mine will focus on additional discussions on those agreements and on things included in our joint statement.”The PM said the government would convey to the Chinese side the priority of Nepal’s development agenda and discuss what type of cooperation the two sides could pursue, among other issues related to trade deficit, projects under the BRI Initiative, rail and road, hydropower and cross-border transmission line and attracting Chinese investment in Nepal. “I will put forth Nepal’s views on all these things during my talks in China,” said Oli.During the visit, Oli will hold delegation-level bilateral talks with his Chinese counterpart Li, and also hold meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Chairman of Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress Li Zhanshu.

Even if we can’t sign it now, it will be signed soon,” he said.Among the new agreements to be signed during the visit are those related to the concept of Trans-Himalayan Multidimensional Connectivity Network that encompasses railways, roads, aviation, optical fibre, port, transmission lines and cultural exchanges.Important agreements, especially in the energy sector, between the private sectors of the two countries will also be signed, according to the minister. The agreements include 1,000-MW Marshyangdi Cascade (three projects), a joint venture between Sichuan Provincial Investment Group and Butwal Power Company, and another hydropower project in the eastern region.Other planned private-sector agreements are China-Nepal Power Grid Interconnection agreement between Nepal Electricity Authority and State Grid Corporation of China, and partnerships in the fields of agriculture, pashmina and cement.On projects under the Chinese-led Belt and Road Initiative, Gyawali said project implementation and financing modalities were being discussed and projects were being prioritised.An agreement to use Tibetan highways for ferrying goods to Nepal will also be signed under which eight entry points will be used, including Hilsa, Rasuwagadi, Riu Tipta La Pass of Taplejung, Pulan-Hilsa, Tinker-Darchula and Urai Pass Bajhang.Gyawali added that an agreement on Kerung-Kathmandu cross-border railway would be signed.An agreement is also on the cards on setting up a mechanism between foreign ministries of Nepal and China which would facilitate dialogue between the two countries on a host of issues.Other agreements planned, according to the minister, are a pact between finance ministries of two countries on building Nepal’s production capacity, an agreement on energy cooperation encompassing the overall energy sector development in Nepal and conducting feasibility studies and an agreement on cross-border electricity transmission line.The minister, however, said there would be no agreement related to Nepal-China Free Trade Area.READ ALSO: Oli aims to get past pacts implemented","['six-day', 'today', 'March 2016', 'June 19']","['China', 'Beijing', 'Nepal', 'Kerung', 'Rasuwagadi', 'Hilsa']","['Nepal-China', 'the Ministry of Foreign Affairs', 'Butwal Power Company', 'Nepal-China Free Trade Area', 'Transit Transport Agreement', 'Sichuan Provincial Investment Group', 'MW Marshyangdi Cascade', 'Nepal Electricity Authority', 'State Grid Corporation of China', 'Trans-Himalayan Multidimensional Connectivity Network', 'Tinker-Darchula']","['Nepal', 'Kumar Gyawali', 'Urai Pass', 'Gyawali', 'KP Sharma Oli’s', 'Riu Tipta La Pass of Taplejung']",thehimalayantimes

The government had started the process of acquiring land in the name of Industrial District Management Ltd (IDML) in seven provinces about two years back. However, land acquisition process has not gathered pace despite the instruction to hasten the process from the prime minister.As per its plan to develop industrial areas in each province, the government has started acquiring land in Damak and Gauradaha of Jhapa for the industrial areas in Province 1. So far, only 1,319bighas of land has been acquired out of the proposed 2,100 bighas.The IDML has established its liaison office in Damak to expedite the land acquisition process, however, progress has been very slow, according Nanda Kishor Basnet, chairman and general manager of IDML. “We have to take consent from the Ministry of Agriculture, Land Management and Cooperatives and the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs at each step of the land acquisition process and this has been causing delays.”Chinese investors have been expressing interest to develop industrial areas to set up industries here due to the geographical proximity with India, Bangladesh and Bhutan. However, IDML needs to acquire land as early as possible to invite the Chinese developers.The industrial areas will be developed as per the BOOT (build, own, operate, transfer) model. Under the BOOT model the project will be handed over to the government after 30 years. The detailed project report (DPR) will be developed after the land acquisition.The IDML has also signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Phingan Trust of Shenzhen, China, which will provide financing to the Chinese investors to invest in the industrial parks as per the government of China’s policy to promote the Belt and Road Initiative also through the participation of the private sector, as per Bhoj Raj Binadi, spokesperson for IDML. “The Lhasa Industrial Development Zone will provide technical expertise as a counterpart developer as per the MoU.”Likewise, land acquisition for the industrial areas in other provinces has not gathered momentum. The DPR of three industrial areas in two provinces is underway, namely, Mayurdhap (200bighas) in Makawanpur of Province 3 and Motipur (813bighas) of Rupandehi and Naubasta (338bighas) of Bankeof Province 5. After the completion of DPR, the IDML will seek the developer for the industrial areas through competitive bidding.The IDML has been carrying out feasibility study of industrial areas in other provinces as well. It has identified 3,000bighas of land in Murtiha of Sarlahi district in Province 2 and 300bighas in Chyalingtar, Gorkha of Province 4. Similarly, feasibility study is underway to develop industrial areas on 1,148bighas of land in Laxmipur, Dang of Province 5; 1,000bighas in Surkhet of Province 6 and 900bighas in Daiji of Kanchanpur district of Province 7.Currently, there are 11 industrial estates and one Special Economic Zone in operation in the country.","['30 years', 'about two years back']","['Naubasta', 'China', 'Laxmipur, Dang of Province 5', 'India', 'Makawanpur of Province', 'Gorkha of Province 4', 'Jhapa', 'Chyalingtar', 'Rupandehi', 'Bhutan', 'Bangladesh', 'Motipur', 'Bankeof Province']","['Damak', 'DPR', 'BOOT', 'The Lhasa Industrial Development Zone', 'Justice', 'Parliamentary Affairs', 'Daiji of Kanchanpur', 'Cooperatives', 'Industrial District Management Ltd', 'IDML', 'Phingan Trust of Shenzhen', 'the Ministry of Law', 'the Ministry of Agriculture, Land Management']","['Mayurdhap', 'Nepal', 'Gauradaha', 'Bhoj Raj Binadi', 'Nanda Kishor Basnet']",thehimalayantimes

As Nepal has also joined the initiative, the time has come to propose large-scale projects to uplift Nepali economy,” he added.BRI could be an opportunity for South Asian countries to increase economic development by bridging the infrastructure gap, according to Shailendra Guragain, president of Independent Power Producers Association - Nepal (IPPAN).Pradhan expressed hope that agreements related to some mega projects of hydropower and rail connectivity will be signed during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s upcoming China visit.IMF’s Lagarde had said that in countries where public debt is already high, careful management of financing terms is critical and also warned that ‘with any large-scale spending, there is sometimes the temptation to take advantage of the selection and bidding process’.",['last month'],"['China', 'IPPAN).Pradhan', 'Lagarde']","['Independent Power Producers Association - Nepal', 'Shailendra Guragain', 'BRI', 'International Monetary Fund', 'IMF', 'Management Association of Nepal', 'Federation of Nepalese Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FNCCI', 'BRI.“The BRI', 'Pradhan']","['Christina Lagarde', 'BRI', 'Nepal', 'Xi Jinping', 'KP Sharma Oli’s', 'Gyanendra Lal Pradhan']",thehimalayantimes

Wang was speaking after meeting Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj in Beijing.""This year, under the guidance of our leaders, the China-India relationship has realised good development and shown a positive momentum,"" Wang said.Modi has sought to re-set ties after disputes over issues including their disputed border with Tibet and other issues.The Asian giants were locked in a 73-day military stand-off in a remote, high-altitude stretch of that boundary last year. At one point, soldiers from the two sides threw stones and punches.The confrontation between the nuclear-armed powers in the Himalayas underscored Indian alarm at China's expanding security and economic links in South Asia.China's ambitious Belt and Road initiative of transport and energy links bypasses India, apart from a corner of the disputed Kashmir region, also claimed by Pakistan, but involves India's neighbours Sri Lanka, Nepal and the Maldives.Modi's previously unannounced Wuhan trip is even more unusual in that he will visit China again in June for a summit of the China and Russia-led security grouping, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which India joined last year.It is almost unheard for foreign leaders to visit China twice in such close succession.Modi's nationalist government has reversed course on its relationship with Beijing apparently after realising its hard line on China was not working.Exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, who lives in India and who China considers a dangerous separatist, is also facing the cold shoulder.In March, India issued an unprecedented ban on Tibetans holding a rally with the Dalai Lama in New Delhi to mark the 60th anniversary of the start of the failed uprising against Chinese rule.Other areas of disagreement remain however between Beijing and New Delhi.China has blocked India's membership of a nuclear cartel and it has also been blocking U.N. sanctions against a Pakistan-based militant leader blamed for attacks on India.","['73-day', 'June', 'Friday', 'Saturday', '""This year', 'last year', 'later this week', 'March']","['China', 'Beijing', 'New Delhi', 'Sri Lanka', 'India', 'Nepal', 'Wuhan', 'Russia', 'Pakistan', 'Tibet']","['Wang', 'the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation', 'State', 'U.N.']","['Narendra Modi', 'Councillor Wang Yi', 'Xi Jinping', 'Sushma Swaraj', 'Wang']",thehimalayantimes
