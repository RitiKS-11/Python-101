I cannot remember seeing this on my last visit. Although that was quite a few years ago.Probably because on The Internet I did not spot a single vendor selling D.V.Ds. However, there are still more than enough stalls selling cheap watches to please even the most fastidious visitor. There appear to be more stalls selling pirated clothing and accessories now than before, but then again it could very well be because of my not being here for a while. As before though, this place is heaving, and it is difficult to wander among some of the stalls because of so many visitors.One thing that has always tickled us is the chap selling roast chestnuts right in the middle of Chinatown. Roasted chestnuts are not something normally associated with a tropical country like Malaysia."

        "title": "A Chinatown Under Transition",
        "body": "Being from California, I always like to see other Chinese Immigration Settlements (Chinatowns) around the world. Chinatown is centered on Petaling Street and originally occupied by \"pioneers\" around the start of the 20th century. The men were mainly Cantonese and Hakkas who had come to the city because of the tin trade, working as coolies in the mines. They were governed by a Chinese Kapitan or headman. Chinatown is currently known for its numerous shops and stalls offering local food, cheap imitation of brand products, clothing, watches, bags, shoes, and more. For buyers, it is often possible to haggle on the price of watches, clothing and all counterfeit items.Typical Chinatowns share their culture and traditions through their local groceries, restaurants, community centers and local events. Although now a popular tourist attraction, Chinatown\u2019s oriental heritage can still be found in places like the historic Chan See Shu Yuen Temple. Lined with decaying 1920\u2019s shophouses crying for restoration and knock-off tourist-centric merchantry along Petaling Street Market, I imagine it has seen better days.Behind these stalls is a \u201csecond layer\u201d of shops and hotels. Many interesting and authentic businesses can be found in this second layer shop. An example is the dim sum restaurant where waitresses push carts of dim sum for guests to choose and where small tea cups in a round steel bowl can be found on each table. A notable landmark within this area is Kwai Chai Hong (Chinese: \u9b3c\u4ed4\u5df7) located through a black gate and wooden bridge leading to Lorong Panggung. It is a back alley behind the shophouses with lots of mural arts managed by Bai Chuan Management Sdn Bhd to make use as a tourist attraction. The name translates literally as Little Ghost Lane or Little Demon Lane in English. The alley features 6 artistic interactive murals with QR codes placed on the walls of each mural illustrating the lives of local Chinese settlers from the 60\u2019s. Notorious vices were prominent in the area, such as opium dens, gambling joints, brothels and gang-related activities.In 2003, Petaling Street underwent a major RM11 million facelift when two large Chinese arches to welcome visitors were placed at either end of the street. A green roof cover was constructed, covering the whole road, dubbed the \"Green Dragon\". The street is now totally pedestrianised and transformed into a pedestrian shopping mall. The Street is regarded as a heritage site.In 2015, Petaling Street started evolving into a new hipster destination, with design-savvy entrepreneurs transforming dilapidated properties into Instagrammable cafes, restaurants, speakeasies, boutique hotels and most recently with REXKL, an arts and culture hub."

        "body": "No vacation is complete without shopping! Welcome to Jalan Petaling in China Town! For those who don't know, this is a popular shopping area. The original business hub of Old Kuala Lumpur is now known as Chinatown. Any traveler to Kuala Lumpur should consider visiting this to experience the street food and shopping. You can discover shops offering local food, imitation of brand products, clothing, watches, bags, shoes, and more on both sides! You can get a sense of what to expect here from this short video. Here, bargaining is important. The sellers are quite cunning and most of them treat you like a walking ATM and will try to get the most price from you. Dress the simplest way possible so that they don't overcharge you a lot! More details will be shared in the description below. Prices should be compared because the items being sold at all stalls are identical. In our own personal experience, the older dealers offered great prices. They won't let you negotiate, yet the price is lower than the competition's and occasionally the quality is even better! So here are few things to keep in mind. The best time to visit Petaling Street is from 10am to 9pm. Everything other than the food stalls usually closes by 9pm. This market specializes in selling fake products so you cannot blame the vendor for selling you these things. Keep your belongings near to you because the market is extremely crowded during peak shopping hours. If you want to get a good price, it is highly recommended that you bargain with the vendors.You have to visit the fresh juice shop right in the middle of this town. This was incredibly refreshing and affordable considering the amount served, in our opinion! Check out my playlists on youtube to find more places to visit in Malaysia!"

I got alot of \"things\" at a price I want when presented.Others not so much but may have \"high quality\" goods to show. Trust me. I got a nice \"I love KL\" shirt, wallets, bags, shoes, I love KL watches, magnets, etc. Good eats too.

Mama Mia, tastes remained unchanged over the years.  If your taste bud is too numb with spices try their lime juice which is balancing for hot spices.If you need something to sweeten your sweet tooth, head for the \"Dau fu fa\"- smooth, soft silky soybean pudding topped with \"Gula Melaka\" (palm sugar).Not forgetting the everlasting \"Lok lok\", steamboat food on skewers and dipped into satay sauce.DISSAPOINTMENT - Chinatown KL has its Chinatown flavour at the stalls selling all kinds of products from combs, handbags to belts, souvenirs.....

And also some sellers are desperate to sell the items, in case you deny buying in the process they might end up cursing you. My little advice to you is \"Touch only if you Buy\" And also try to have lot of change with you when heading to China Town because you might not get your balance for the higher notes. But all the sellers were not the same. There were some good ones, if you are lucky you might also end up getting too many buy one get ones (Real good products) The best things to buy here are shoes, handbags,bags, wallets and perfumes.

Chinatown is very exciting at night because there are more vendors and the vibe pumps with high energy.  During the day the leased shops operate but very few informal stalls so, go at night.  Be prepared to be offered every kind of thing at every kind of price and NO PRICE is set.  You will be offered the highest and you have room to negotiate to at least 50% less than what was offered.  You can buy good 'wannabee' design labels that are so well made that only a trained eye can see the difference. Some very good massages are also offered in and around the market but,  choose well.  You can catch the monorail to relatively close buy but, you need to know your way around to walk the 1km to the market.  All cabs operate in and around the market and there is a bus terminal on Jalan Petaling.  You simply must visit Chinatown when you are in Kuala Lumpur as it redefines just how much money you DONT need to be spending on designer labels!!  People are generally friendly and helpful and you need to be mindful to not wave your cash around as the folks who work at the market are from lower socio-economical levels.  They are all trying to make a living and will do whatever they can to make a sale and take some money home.  I am NOT referring to theft but rather their need to survive. So you need to be mindful of it and not exploit what is already a low price.  I will ALWAYS return to Chinatown"

Chinatown has a great vibe, as tourist and locals wander leisurely down the aisles searching for a bargain or two.Plenty of food places, from street food to more pretentious restaurants offering a range of delectable choices.Avoid visiting on the weekend, crazy crowds make the experience less enjoyable. Have fun!!"

For e.g for a fake Burberry sling bag we were quoted a price from 120 to 45...final price was 30. The shops at the beginning of the street (both ways) usually quoted the highest price. Best time to visit us evening as it can get hot and humid. The only bad experience we had was with some of the Bangladeshi vendors who were always ready to pick a fight. Having said that there were other Bangladeshi vendors who were very polite and good so it is not a general observation on Bangladeshis but we did not face this issue with vendors from other nationalities so would advise against getting into a conversation with the Bangladeshi vendors.

We are frequent travellers to KL and we tend to travel two to three times a year and every time we visit China Town we face the same issue no matter what and how we say (or not say). Some might consider this racism, but many will consider it a fair warning. Even my Malaysian friends tell me they avoid China Town (Petaling Street) because of them. The Chinese and Malays, on the other hand, are more respectful and tolerant.Do yourself a favor and go to Sungai Wang and Times Square instead ....

I would suggest to come for a roam in the afternoon or evening when the whole area are fully \"awake\" and active. If you have been to Bukit Bintang or other night markets in Petaling Jaya such as SS2 (durians etc), probably there is nothing too excited about. Not trying to downgrade the famous tourist spot, its probably over touristic or commercial due to huge influx or tourists over long years, hence the feel is not a local spot where you could rub shoulders with locals like SS2."

However, the atmosphere is friendly and very buzzing. The aroma of beautiful Chinese food is all around you, and it is difficult to escape without trying some. The prices are average, but the taste is great, as is all Malaysian food.

I had wantan soup for 6ringit. partner had a help yourself stir fry type meal for 10ringit and got some for takeaway as well. seriously cheap!!!! everyone just does their own thing, lots of locals lots of tourists. happy people embracing the heat. wear comfy shoes, take lots of water, wear comfy light clothes. grab yourself a slushie or bubble tea to escape the heat a bit. we went to 'tai one' for a mango slush. would definitely come back just  for the atmosphere.

You do find quite a lot of things there, but Not that much as I expected. The sellers there are sometimes Rude and become annoying, if you are reluctant to buy after a failed negotiation of price - bargaining isn't much the appreciated.

My advise, do not bargain if you do not intend to buy... seller might be force you to buy because you had bargain.Not all , but some can be ugly. You can buy some souvenirs like T-shirt,key-chain etc. Better to buy something that display the price.  The highlight of this place is the drink  - Air Mata Kucing. Its located at the center. Its just a cart, but you will see people ordering and stand there to drink and some take away.

Once you're done perusing the Chinese selection, you're only a block away from the Central Market where local Malaysian products are sold and Visa is accepted.

These grubs don't care what injuries you sustain and are ruthless. According to police Chinatown is a hot spot as they know tourists flock there, and as I didn't have my bag across my body was a bonus as bag came off easier so therefore I was not dragged a longer distance, but still sustained injuries, the thing that hurts the most is when your head hits the road, so bloody dangerous.

When the Chinese owner brought the 15 satay to us and asked for RM30 (RM2 per stick). We were shocked because we never have such expensive hawker satay before in all our prior trips in KL. We asked the Chinese owner how come his satay is so expensive compare to the nearby Malay satay stall. He arrogantly told us off that all the satay stalls in Chinatown sell at the price RM2 and we can don\u2019t patronise his stall and eat somewhere else.

Then I got a bag and paid him 30 ringgit as its priced.I felt the bag was very light and shouldn't as weight as 1 kilo but I was in a hurry so it's ok if It's 100-200 grams less. But when I was on the way to hotel and stopped by supermarket. I had an idea to weight the chestnut I bought on the supermarket measurement. Oh my God the chest nut was 0.468 kilogram which I paid for 30 ringgit !!! So be careful if you want to buy the chestnut and would be great to avoid the stall I mentioned.

It is a different experience of shopping in air conditioned comfort like in the Central Market - which is housed in an air conditioned building.Essentially it is a big market with lots of stalls - and you should not forget your haggling skills.

The moment I entered while holding my 10 year old inside with my family. I felt ease. We reached about 1pm and most of the shops were already operating. We didn't see any empty shop.Adult- Shoes, Bags, Clothes, Make Ups, watches, Accessories Wow!!! All 100% imitation goods that looks do close to the original... You name it and it's there... My teenage boy bought a Rolex which was quoted RM $300 and after a quick bargaining he hot it for RM $50. Tip: don't show u are too keen even if u like it. Quote close to half the price the owner quote you. Then just say OK that's it last price you give me I buy or I'm going back. They will immediately give wat u offer.Children--Toys, Bags, soft toys and toys like in kiddy palace. my. Younger son bought a watch, hat and hotwheelsToys all for jus RM 70 worth it as it's of good quality.Food- of you are street food explorer this the right place. Little stalls with friendly owners selling their delicacy with a smile. It was awesome trying the snacks. Soya bean Is a must to try as it melts in the mouth. Mmmm... I love the food.People - as much as crowd started coming in and I was holding my boy hand and keep g him close I stil felt safe but very vigilant. Tip: do not carry big bags. We used money belt which was under our shirt and not accessible to any one. It looked as though we were not carrying anything. Safer. A money belt simply costs $4 in Q10 or carousel. Get one it's usef.Finally its a place u must visit and for a good shopping it's the best most affordable place. "

Here you will find high quality replicas you will be asked a very high price, pay what you hare happy with for these high end copies. Check the brand and model name on your internet see if it matches some are vastly different to the ones you are showed. Secondly check the quality of the wrist band this s were most fail the test. If possible visit a genuine watch store take a picture of the watch you want and show this to him.Handbags same applies, take a picture of the one you like, some will have a showroom with very high quality items.Do not seem too seem interested in the item you like, remember keep walking away until you get the price you want.As a guide I bought a reasonable copy Bag 34 MYR starting price was 120MYR."

That stall is still there but the atmosphere is a lot different since KL City Hall made it a covered pedestrian mall.It was and still is a long row of stalls selling clothes, electronic goods, fake watches, handbags, souvenirs and an array of items - one that locals don't frequent owing to rude stall owners, poor quality goods and inflated prices. It is more of a tourist trap.You can be forgiven if you think you are in Dhaka and not Kuala Lumpur since most of these stalls have now been rented out and are run by Bangladeshis.It is not so Chinatown anymore - more of a a cosmopolitan town with Chinese deco I'd say. Chinese New Year and Chinese festivals are a good time to visit if you want to catch a glimpse of Chinese culture because KL's Chinatown is quite culturally diverse than it is Chinatown.Back then and even nowadays, us locals usually make our way to the shops behind the stalls - these are mostly wholesalers - toys, clothes, florists etc. Here, you get a better choice of items, and prices are fixed and reasonable (prices at the stalls can go up to three time more if you do not know how to bargain).All said and done, Petaling Street is still a place to get authentic Malaysian Chinese street food, though sometimes one needs to turn a blind eye to the lack of ambiance.If ambiance and a little history is what you are looking for - there are some small quaint cafes that you might need to check out. These have been set up in the old pre-war shop lots along the road including Merchant's Lane (a quaint cafe in what at one time was a brothel), Old China Cafe, Lucy in the Sky and Urban Artisan Cafe among others.Do visit Chinatown to catch SOME glimpses of old KL (sadly little effort has been made to preserve the rich history of this area)"

Beer was cheap hence memory a little clouded.Great people watching here too.On to the stalls, good for a look around and a barter if you fancy it. Some good quality fakes but also some horrible ones. The nike t shirts with Adidas labels were a bit of a give away. If you have a good memory try remember prices you get offered and use those prices against each vendor.For a rough guide on some pricing we paid - NBA singlets were 70MYR, Ray Bans - 120MYR (we didn't even try barter as the guy was honest and said they were fakes but good quality so we gave him credit for that), Fridge magnets 4 for 10MYR, Dress was approx two for 35MYR and scarves in pashmina if that makes sense was 3 for 50MYR.If you got better deals don't break our egos and keep them to yourself \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02"

Only a couple of hundred easy metres to Chinatown (Petaling St).Mostly poor quality goods however I did find a decent quality waterproof backpack for my motorbike and hubby found a good quality, great looking KTM hat.There is a food court type area which is okay, but there are better places to eat in KL (eg. Lot 10 Hutong, \"The Market\" which is an underground food market near Fahrenheit shopping centre).The lanterns look pretty and it's worth checking out but don't put all your eggs in one basket with this place."

Chinatown is also a well-known bargain hunter\u2019s paradise, a place where you can find all sorts of stuff from Chinese herbs to imitation goods. At night, its main market area, Petaling Street, transforms into a lively and vibrant night market, filled with hundreds of stalls offering all kinds of goods at dirt-cheap prices, and the place is usually crowded with locals as well as tourists. The best thing is, the prices can be brought lower still as haggling is the way of life here!The area has dozens of restaurants and food stalls, serving local favourites. Traders here are mainly Chinese, but there are also Indian, Malay and Bangladeshi traders. Nearby is the Jamek Mosque, an old mosque of Moorish architecture, as well as the Central Market, all accessible within walking distance. One of Kuala Lumpur's famous landmarks, the Sri Maha-Mariamman Temple, Kuala Lumpur, is located close by.

In the wholesale tea house at the end of Jalan Sultan they have excellent White tea and very special tea porcelain \u201cJian Zhan\u201d (black porcelain)  - we really enjoyed the tea tasting.

Although you will find that the merchandise is pretty much the same throughout. What you need to do is make sure that you never agree to pay whatever the shop keeper says the price is right away. They would love to get you to pay the highest price they quote. But they are willing to take a lot less. Lady's handbags can be had for about $25 if you buy them on the street. For the better quality bags, the shop owners will offer to take you to a private room in a building off the street. Don't be alarmed. You are not being taken somewhere to be robbed. The good stuff is kept locked up away from the street. Bags there are more expensive. Watches are the same. You will pay between $20 and $25 for knock-off watches on the street, but the good quality knock-offs are in a room locked up. Those can cost between $90 and $150. Bargain hard. If they won't come down to a price you are willing to pay. Leave! Find another shop and start the process over again. Unless your price point is just too low, someone may meet your price so that they can move their inventory. Food also is all over in Chinatown. Honestly, I have never eaten down there. I am pretty adventurous about what I will eat. But I have limits, and I seem to hit them when I go to Chinatown. I know that there are a couple of restaurants down there right on the main streets that are supposed to be pretty good and safe. I always stay in a hotel that is attached to two very nice malls with a myriad of great restaurant choices. So for me, I wait until I get back to my hotel before I eat. Expect Chinatown to be hot, humid and crowed. It gets even more crowed at night. But enjoy it. It is lively and fun to see what is for sale. You may find some things you hadn't considered looking for. Decide what you think a \"good\" deal would be and hold the line on your price. If they won't meet it, walk. It's only a good deal if you get if for the price you wanted to pay. Getting back to your hotel is easy. There are plenty of taxis at the end of each of the two streets that make up the primary market. Don't miss Chinatown. Enjoy it and have fun with your negotiating."

We took a taxi and the driver dropped us off right in front of the main entrance where there is a large gate with Chinese Signage put up above between two round red wooden beam (see photo). We found the street was not too busy (probably early for that time of day) .There were stalls on either side of the relatively wide footpaths which led us to a 'T' junction, We decided that we would take a left turn and walk down that side of the pathway until the end and then walk back, pass the T junction over to the other end of the pathway. The pathways were not long and we covered the first end after 10 - 15 minutes. On the way back we stopped at a freshly made waffle stall. The man makes these delicious crushed nut and sugar filled waffles. We bought some and they tasted really delicious. We also stopped by a Chinese herbal drinks stall where my wife bought us some ice cold Chinese herbal drink - very refreshing. Overall the place was not busy and I couldn't find many restaurant stall like the one at Jalan Alor. Once we walked to the other end of the pathway. we continued walking out of the 'China Town' area and stumbled across an Indian Temple and Chinese Temple. The Chinese Temple was gated and closed. The Indian Temple was opened but we did not enter the temple as there was a large crowd just entering the temple as we arrived.It was early evening when we finished wandering around the China Town part of Petaling Jalan and I found a claypot rice stall at the side of a street near Petaling Street.

Not a person who goes beyond the comfort area when it comes to food, but I tasted some of the foods of tofu/ beans / fishes. Eating by chopsticks was something memorable to me. After lunch, we roamed around Chinatown. Even in the midday, there was no shortage of live music and other performances on street. My friend offered local delicacies including beverages and pair of cake in yellow and pink colour representing reunion of two families while tying the knot in Chinese culture. We would have spent not more than an hour and half in Chinatown having lunch and roaming around in the midst of Saturday afternoon but I will cherish the experience and company of my Chinese friend for many years to come.

The hardest working man in Chinatown bakes pancakes 7 days a week all year around and has been doing this for decades.

For an example if they ask for RM130 for a handbag you must request  it for RM 40 and gradually increase and then you can buy it for about RM 60.

They said they can pickup. just before the day they sent a message saying they can not pick up from the hotel and asked us to come to MATIC which is in the city.I took Grab(app like Uber as Uber is not available there) went to MATIC by paying 65 RM 10 minutes before the pickup time. stood around the security guard for 20 minutes, and asked him if the address mentioned is correct. he said to go to some other building when I showed him the address for pickup.I didn't had internet available in phone as I didnt activate international roaming. I went to nearby Starbucks to get internet by purchasing coffee, enabled roaming by paying 25$ to my network provider. Called up Tripadvisor number. They contacted the tour provider, Tour provider called the car driver.Only way to communicate with driver was through whatsapp , his phone number was suspended.Somehow the driver came and pickeup after loosing 40 minutes from the initial time. At the end I paid him 100RM to drop me back to hotel.Lesson learned:1. if you have to pay so much to get picked up from MATIC then you might as well book car from GRAB to go directly to Batu caves and back it will be cheaper.2. buy a local sim, even if for a day. way more cheaper than spending additional dollars while hunting for internet etc.3. Confirm everything even pickup point before paying, as once paid you really are left with no option but to comply with what they say. In a sense I would say if we could have easily done self touring with the amount spent just to get hold of the tour guys. Its like we paid Tripadvisor for free."

Instead, he sat in his car smoking. When my husband and I arrived in his car it reeked of smoke. The drive to the cave was 25 minutes in which time I was getting a headache from the cigarette smell. Our driver barely spoke English so could not tell us anything about the site we were about to see. Tour description said driver will speak English. Once we arrived at the caves and began climbing the steps up, I was told I couldn't enter because I was wearing shorts. There was nothing in the tour description saying that women were to dress in a specific manner. I didn't know it was a religious site. We asked driver to take us back to the hotel and didn't complete the rest of tour. Was feeling siick from the cigarette reeking car. This tour left out important information, driver could barely speak English and company shouldn't allow drivers to smoke in cars. Some people are allergic to smoke!

He forewarned us that there were two stops on the tour that people didn't like so I was prepared. The first stop is to Royal Selangor which is a pewter factory in the city. Definitely not the 'countryside' as the tour title states but pretty interesting nonetheless. Our second stop was at a hand-painted shop where they made scarves and other fashion items (i.e. shirts, paintings, etc.). Again, not a 'countryside' activity but I was going along for the ride. Finally got to the caves about 90 to 100 minutes in to the tour and we spent about an hour there. Very beautiful temple and caves! Dress comfortably bc the hike up the steps, if you want to go to the top, isn't easy but it's worth it in my opinion. Also be cautious around the monkeys. They will steal things out of your hand if you're not paying attention. Finally, keep in mind it is a temple so it's necessary to be respectful when going to the various parts such as taking off your shoes in certain areas or talking with a soft voice. Our guide was great, as I mentioned before, but a little tough to understand at times due to his accent but I could make out what he said for the most part. Overall, a good tour. "

        "body": "This is a great tour, much better (in my opinion) than the city tour of KL.First of all, Batu caves are an amazing sight to see. I was unfamiliar with Hindu Temples, and this is definitely a great one to see. BTW watch out for monks who try to convince you to put holy ash on your forehead (if you're not Hindu), as it's in no way required and it will cost you a few ringgit. Also watch out for plastic bags around the monkeys, they will steal the bag without fail.The Royal Selangor pewter factory is a great visit as well. It's interesting learning the history of the company, and the history of KL as well (the two are very intertwined). There's a massive showroom where you can buy pewter goods, or gold/silver jewelry if you want. It's very cool.You also have the option to go to a Batik Factory and a chocolate factory. It's nice to look at the Batik, but I can't exactly recommend buying it. You can easily buy machine printed Batik in any shopping mall, probably for much cheaper. It is interesting seeing how the Batik is made I guess. The chocolate at the chocolate factory is really good and reasonably cheap; but again, you can easily buy chocolate at basically any shopping mall.Finally, our tour guide was a great guy. Unfortunately I can't remember his name, but in general all tour guides from Asni tours are good.Great tour to do."

Then, when I called them at 9:13-ish, they have no clue where the car is and when they will come.  They finally came at 9:23am.  They said that it is a shared tour.  It may be a shared tour but the bookings are done the day before.  You give people a rough time and then go there at about that time +/- 5-10 minutes.  They don't care as much.  Perhaps, this is the culture of the tour operators here.  But, if you want timeliness, you perhaps should ask in advance and go with another tour operator.The tour guide was a driver who had some information.  He was not very knowledgeable but went on an on about his philosophy of life, etc.  Learned a bit about the pewter factory and some version of the folklore and information about the Batu caves.The time left at the pewter factory was too little.  They have a museum at the Royal Selangor and we were rushed through the museum into the factory.  Of course, there was lots of time at the showroom where they were selling things.At the Batu Caves, there is enough time to do the caves.  I also did the Ramayana caves, which were interesting.Overall, the Batu Caves are an interesting sight to visit.  But, the natural beauty of the temples has been desecrated by these garish, gaudy temples.  I suppose there is not much better to do in KL and so we go with this."

We went to the beautiful temple where we got a blessing and a good luck bracelet and a banana to feed the monkeys. A truly spiritual experience. Lots of monkeys around but we'll behaved.  When we came down we had a lovely drink of nice cool coconut water. Fresh coconut delicious. From the caves we went on to the hot water springs. This amazing water bubbles up from under the ground. Lots of locals there for the healing properties of the springs. I had reflexology on my feet my a local man and got some herb rub for my sore foot all for less than  \u20ac20. My husband sat with his feet in the hot spring. During a thunder storm we then went to the most beautiful waterfalls. A climb again but oh so worth it.

The car is spacious and air conditioned which was welcomed. There were two other tourists in the car (so four in total) so that was nice as I want sure if it would be a coach and we oils have to stop lots. First we stopped briefly in a special location where we could get a good photo op with Petronas Towers before heading off to the caves. Along the way Raja was extremely knowledgeable, he spoke alot about Malaysian culture and politics which was really interesting. Batu caves were great, I'd recommend going in the morning as it got busier as we were leaving and there is less chance of rain. Wear comfortable covered shoes and keep hold of your belongings. We saw the monkeys take food as well as a camera which they dropped down the stairs! Make sure you bring a light coverup to hide your arms/chest and wear long trousers/skirt. You will have to keep covered as you climb, so the lighter the better. We spent about an 1.5hrs at the caves which was plenty of time to climb up and down, rest at the top and visit the temple and shops. Please ensure you remove your shoes before stepping in front of the temple, we saw many tourists remove their shoes right outside which was very disrespectful.After the Batu caves we headed to the Batik store. We spent about 20 minutes there and got to see how the material was made which was very interesting. There was lots to buy but we weren't in the market, luckily we weren't pressured to buy anything and were allowed to wait in the car whilst another member of the tour purchased a few items. Final stop was Royal Selangor, I wasn't really looking forward to this but I was really pleasantly surprised. Our guide within the centre was great, told us all about the history of the company and some of the earlier items. We then got to see the different steps along making items which was fascinating. Malaysia's production of pewter was something I knew nothing about prior to attending but I'm glad I do now. Afterwards we went to the gift shop, there's a range of items available. It was fascinating window shopping and in the end I purchased a small commemorative doing for 50RM. On the way back to the city Raja told us more about Kuala Lumpur. We actually learnt more about the Petronas towers than we did on the tour itself! He also took us through the villages which was fantastic to see. We asked to be dropped at the shopping centre rather than our hotel which Raja did so that was great as we could have some lunch. Overall the tour lasted 3.5hrs, it was great value for money and we really were lucky getting Raja as a guide!"

Edwin picked me up and then we picked up a family of 3. As it looked like it was going to rain he suggested we do the Batu Caves first as the other 2 were in-doors. Just as we arrived it started raining; a little at first. As I walked up the 272 steps slowly (not very fit) the heavens opened up. It was a good thing that I had taken an umbrella and a what I though was a water-proof jacket (it turned out not to be). Anyway I was determined to reach the top. So glad I preservered. I\u2019ve never seen such unique temples - beautiful and colourful. And the location well impressive! The rain got worse and I had no choice but to very slowly make my way down the steps which by now had turned into a waterfall. I don\u2019t know how I managed to make it all the way down without falling.

Private, new aircon car, and he was accommodating to whatever we wanted to do, as all elements are free to enter.The caves are naturally huge & beautiful that have had Hindu temples (very colorful; loud music) erected in them. While respecting the meaning for Hindu people, I would have preferred a natural cave environment, and found the combination an unpleasant clash. From a practical perspective, there are 272 stairs to traverse alongside monkeys that can be somewhat aggressive, so you're advised not to take anything with you. The stairs are uneven, there are no handrails but there are walls you can hold on to. The monkeys climb all over them, so I'd wished I'd had clean wipes or sanitizer for my hands. Once inside, there are no facilities but a water hose to wash hands.You need to take off your shoes before entering the temple, which isn't the same as a Chinese or Japanese temple, and I didn't find it worth going barefoot or getting socks wet. There are more stairs down then up again to get to another temple that blares Hindi music. Back down the stairs outside, there are a couple other caves to explore. On the far left as you look at the gold statue is one that costs RM5, and although naturally beautiful, has had a series of scenes set up depicting Hindu gods and godesses almost like an alternative Disneyland without the animatronics. Frankly, to this westerner, it was unpleasant, gaudy to the extreme, and hard to find any sense of serenity.I heavily cropped selected pictures to get just a flavor of the temples. In real life, the temples were a mix of colors that completely clashed with the natural cave surroundings."

On the way back he stopped in the middle of the road asking us to download an app. Not a good guide nor a good driver. The place itself worth a visit"

        "body": "The only reason we have chosen this tour instead of going there by taxi (slightly cheaper) or by LTR (much much cheaper)  was because of the reviews about how the guides where nice and helpful with Malasyan stories etc. Well. being only us on the tour they thought we weren't worth to have one! We only got the driver who specifically told us \"no, no, I'm not guide, only driver\". The good think on being alone was that we could manage the time as desired. Batu cave only took an hour.As I said on title, the batik factory was a joke, 30 second of useless demonstration and they run you in their huge store. We left immediately.Almost the same at the chocolate factory. Honestly, we were planning to possibly buy some as a gift for our beloveds. They showed us a bit more about cocoa  but at the end we had to deal with the most expensive chocolate in the world! An almond coated with  chocolate and cocoa powder was so far more expensive than a fine Belgian praline! The Royal Selangor pewter factory was, on the other hand, a great experience. We enjoyed even more than Batu (maybe because there I didn't have to carry my boy on my shoulder all up the 272 steps :))) the guide at the museum, Grace, did a great job with us and my kid.So, my final thought is: if you are not interested in buying silk batik and overpriced chocolate skip the tour and go by train. there is a stop 3 minutes from the Batu entrance and it costs only 2.5 MR per person.Or, considering that the tour price still is not that much (we paid 30 $ for 2 adults and 1 kid) you may still join the tour but ask the tour operator to skip absolutely the batik and choco and focus on the pewter factory."
