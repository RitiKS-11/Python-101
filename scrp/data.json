I cannot remember seeing this on my last visit. Although that was quite a few years ago.Probably because on The Internet I did not spot a single vendor selling D.V.Ds. However, there are still more than enough stalls selling cheap watches to please even the most fastidious visitor. There appear to be more stalls selling pirated clothing and accessories now than before, but then again it could very well be because of my not being here for a while. As before though, this place is heaving, and it is difficult to wander among some of the stalls because of so many visitors.One thing that has always tickled us is the chap selling roast chestnuts right in the middle of Chinatown. Roasted chestnuts are not something normally associated with a tropical country like Malaysia."

        "title": "A Chinatown Under Transition",
        "body": "Being from California, I always like to see other Chinese Immigration Settlements (Chinatowns) around the world. Chinatown is centered on Petaling Street and originally occupied by \"pioneers\" around the start of the 20th century. The men were mainly Cantonese and Hakkas who had come to the city because of the tin trade, working as coolies in the mines. They were governed by a Chinese Kapitan or headman. Chinatown is currently known for its numerous shops and stalls offering local food, cheap imitation of brand products, clothing, watches, bags, shoes, and more. For buyers, it is often possible to haggle on the price of watches, clothing and all counterfeit items.Typical Chinatowns share their culture and traditions through their local groceries, restaurants, community centers and local events. Although now a popular tourist attraction, Chinatown\u2019s oriental heritage can still be found in places like the historic Chan See Shu Yuen Temple. Lined with decaying 1920\u2019s shophouses crying for restoration and knock-off tourist-centric merchantry along Petaling Street Market, I imagine it has seen better days.Behind these stalls is a \u201csecond layer\u201d of shops and hotels. Many interesting and authentic businesses can be found in this second layer shop. An example is the dim sum restaurant where waitresses push carts of dim sum for guests to choose and where small tea cups in a round steel bowl can be found on each table. A notable landmark within this area is Kwai Chai Hong (Chinese: \u9b3c\u4ed4\u5df7) located through a black gate and wooden bridge leading to Lorong Panggung. It is a back alley behind the shophouses with lots of mural arts managed by Bai Chuan Management Sdn Bhd to make use as a tourist attraction. The name translates literally as Little Ghost Lane or Little Demon Lane in English. The alley features 6 artistic interactive murals with QR codes placed on the walls of each mural illustrating the lives of local Chinese settlers from the 60\u2019s. Notorious vices were prominent in the area, such as opium dens, gambling joints, brothels and gang-related activities.In 2003, Petaling Street underwent a major RM11 million facelift when two large Chinese arches to welcome visitors were placed at either end of the street. A green roof cover was constructed, covering the whole road, dubbed the \"Green Dragon\". The street is now totally pedestrianised and transformed into a pedestrian shopping mall. The Street is regarded as a heritage site.In 2015, Petaling Street started evolving into a new hipster destination, with design-savvy entrepreneurs transforming dilapidated properties into Instagrammable cafes, restaurants, speakeasies, boutique hotels and most recently with REXKL, an arts and culture hub."

        "body": "No vacation is complete without shopping! Welcome to Jalan Petaling in China Town! For those who don't know, this is a popular shopping area. The original business hub of Old Kuala Lumpur is now known as Chinatown. Any traveler to Kuala Lumpur should consider visiting this to experience the street food and shopping. You can discover shops offering local food, imitation of brand products, clothing, watches, bags, shoes, and more on both sides! You can get a sense of what to expect here from this short video. Here, bargaining is important. The sellers are quite cunning and most of them treat you like a walking ATM and will try to get the most price from you. Dress the simplest way possible so that they don't overcharge you a lot! More details will be shared in the description below. Prices should be compared because the items being sold at all stalls are identical. In our own personal experience, the older dealers offered great prices. They won't let you negotiate, yet the price is lower than the competition's and occasionally the quality is even better! So here are few things to keep in mind. The best time to visit Petaling Street is from 10am to 9pm. Everything other than the food stalls usually closes by 9pm. This market specializes in selling fake products so you cannot blame the vendor for selling you these things. Keep your belongings near to you because the market is extremely crowded during peak shopping hours. If you want to get a good price, it is highly recommended that you bargain with the vendors.You have to visit the fresh juice shop right in the middle of this town. This was incredibly refreshing and affordable considering the amount served, in our opinion! Check out my playlists on youtube to find more places to visit in Malaysia!"

Once you start to barder in front of other customers they will listen to you more and get you out quick so the others don't here your price. Just my thought. I got alot of \"things\" at a price I want when presented.Others not so much but may have \"high quality\" goods to show. Trust me. I got a nice \"I love KL\" shirt, wallets, bags, shoes, I love KL watches, magnets, etc. Good eats too.

Mama Mia, tastes remained unchanged over the years.  If your taste bud is too numb with spices try their lime juice which is balancing for hot spices.If you need something to sweeten your sweet tooth, head for the \"Dau fu fa\"- smooth, soft silky soybean pudding topped with \"Gula Melaka\" (palm sugar).Not forgetting the everlasting \"Lok lok\", steamboat food on skewers and dipped into satay sauce.DISSAPOINTMENT - Chinatown KL has its Chinatown flavour at the stalls selling all kinds of products from combs, handbags to belts, souvenirs.....

One seller told my husband upon asking a bag\u2019s price that you cannot afford it. A girl seller said to me that don\u2019t ask prices if you don\u2019t want to buy. Despite that we found some good sellers who were nice and we a few good bags and wallets from them. Other than this, they actually start with 200 and come to 40 RM."

Chinatown is very exciting at night because there are more vendors and the vibe pumps with high energy.  During the day the leased shops operate but very few informal stalls so, go at night.  Be prepared to be offered every kind of thing at every kind of price and NO PRICE is set.  You will be offered the highest and you have room to negotiate to at least 50% less than what was offered.  You can buy good 'wannabee' design labels that are so well made that only a trained eye can see the difference. Some very good massages are also offered in and around the market but,  choose well.  You can catch the monorail to relatively close buy but, you need to know your way around to walk the 1km to the market.  All cabs operate in and around the market and there is a bus terminal on Jalan Petaling.  You simply must visit Chinatown when you are in Kuala Lumpur as it redefines just how much money you DONT need to be spending on designer labels!!  People are generally friendly and helpful and you need to be mindful to not wave your cash around as the folks who work at the market are from lower socio-economical levels.  They are all trying to make a living and will do whatever they can to make a sale and take some money home.  I am NOT referring to theft but rather their need to survive. So you need to be mindful of it and not exploit what is already a low price.  I will ALWAYS return to Chinatown"

I told them it's a RM 20 and I saw the guy put the rm 20 note in a plastic box. But he point to another rm 10 note that next to the plastic box and said that is the note I gave them. I'm a tourist but I am not new here. I've been to Kuala Lumpur more than 10 times. My pocket has only two RM 20 notes at that time and I am sure that they scammed me!"

Best time to visit us evening as it can get hot and humid. The only bad experience we had was with some of the Bangladeshi vendors who were always ready to pick a fight. Having said that there were other Bangladeshi vendors who were very polite and good so it is not a general observation on Bangladeshis but we did not face this issue with vendors from other nationalities so would advise against getting into a conversation with the Bangladeshi vendors.

Some might consider this racism, but many will consider it a fair warning. Even my Malaysian friends tell me they avoid China Town (Petaling Street) because of them. The Chinese and Malays, on the other hand, are more respectful and tolerant.Do yourself a favor and go to Sungai Wang and Times Square instead ....

A commonly employed trick is for the customer to walk away, apparently disagreeable about the price and the seller calls them back for a \"last\" price!  If you are there at 4.00pm, you will see a \"transformation\" taking place - existing stalls making way for new ones. It's amazing how fast the stalls are put up with very slick handling."

If you have been to Bukit Bintang or other night markets in Petaling Jaya such as SS2 (durians etc), probably there is nothing too excited about. Not trying to downgrade the famous tourist spot, its probably over touristic or commercial due to huge influx or tourists over long years, hence the feel is not a local spot where you could rub shoulders with locals like SS2."

The famous Chinatown in Petaling Street surrounded by many very old historical shop houses and temples  are home to many delightful local street food/drinks that has been operated for many generations. There are too few beautiful lanes duly upgraded with beautiful artwork along the walls and the lanes good to walk through and pictures shooting. Just across the main road is Central Market where there sell almost similar clothing & souvenir staffs that you can buy at almost half the prices in Chinatown open market. Shopping in Chinatown is exciting when you know how to bargain. Daytime here is not as much happening during the night. Nevertheless travellers is recommended to live around Chinatown where they are plenty of inexpensive hotels/Inns/Guest houses around. Travelling in and around KL & Klang Valley also makes easier as there are many public transports which are very convenient here."

My advise, do not bargain if you do not intend to buy... seller might be force you to buy because you had bargain.Not all , but some can be ugly. You can buy some souvenirs like T-shirt,key-chain etc. Better to buy something that display the price.  The highlight of this place is the drink  - Air Mata Kucing. Its located at the center. Its just a cart, but you will see people ordering and stand there to drink and some take away.

My fav food stalls are still here e.g. the lor hon guo in the corner, the kim tau fu fah, the Hokkien mee stall.  Seeing these familiar stalls brought a smile back to my face.  Sure the number of vendors selling fake goods is still a lot but there is so much more to this place, the many sellers hawking food and fruit and also stores selling everything from textile to Chinese New Year lanterns and decorations.  I found myself loving the experience of re-discovering old favourites and discovering new ones, like the very good Urban Artisan ice-cream shop."

We went to patronise them on yesterday night (29 Jan 2019) and ordered 15 sticks (thinking is RM1 because we had our satay supper on the night before at a Malay Stall nearby). When the Chinese owner brought the 15 satay to us and asked for RM30 (RM2 per stick). We were shocked because we never have such expensive hawker satay before in all our prior trips in KL. We asked the Chinese owner how come his satay is so expensive compare to the nearby Malay satay stall. He arrogantly told us off that all the satay stalls in Chinatown sell at the price RM2 and we can don\u2019t patronise his stall and eat somewhere else.

However, focus has been shifted to new KLCC near Bukit Bintang. Chinatown nowadays makes a neglected impression. Parts of Petaling street almost look like in ruins, also because they built a new highway at the end causing a dead end! The street market is not very pleasant, though they built a roof over part of Petaling street. Especially in the evening there are just too many stalls and hawkers. The quality of goods on offer is often mediocre, as are the prices.I can imagine why most locals avoid the place and flock to the new modern airconditioned malls flanked by impressive skyscrapers.

Every taxi awaiting you will charge you double or treble the legal fare which does make a  disappointing end to the day.Ps. One of my friends who visited with me purchased a blouse that broke when she put it on the very next day and getting it changed was nearly impossible - overall experience was one of being taken advantage of by the locals.

We didn't see any empty shop.Adult- Shoes, Bags, Clothes, Make Ups, watches, Accessories Wow!!! All 100% imitation goods that looks do close to the original... You name it and it's there... My teenage boy bought a Rolex which was quoted RM $300 and after a quick bargaining he hot it for RM $50. Tip: don't show u are too keen even if u like it. Quote close to half the price the owner quote you. Then just say OK that's it last price you give me I buy or I'm going back. They will immediately give wat u offer.Children--Toys, Bags, soft toys and toys like in kiddy palace. my. Younger son bought a watch, hat and hotwheelsToys all for jus RM 70 worth it as it's of good quality.Food- of you are street food explorer this the right place. Little stalls with friendly owners selling their delicacy with a smile. It was awesome trying the snacks. Soya bean Is a must to try as it melts in the mouth. Mmmm... I love the food.People - as much as crowd started coming in and I was holding my boy hand and keep g him close I stil felt safe but very vigilant. Tip: do not carry big bags. We used money belt which was under our shirt and not accessible to any one. It looked as though we were not carrying anything. Safer. A money belt simply costs $4 in Q10 or carousel.

Then got a conversation going he wanted to visit UK etc and wanted to know the currency. In the meantime, his partner wanted my wife to take a photo of her by a shop. Didn\u2019t think much of it but did find it very strange as the stranger wanted to see British sterling pounds which I did not show. My wife\u2019s bank had blocked her card (Natwest-RECOMMENDED) due to unusual activity, online banking was done on the SAME day that couple approached us. The guy did show me his wallet which was strange showing a thick \u2018wad\u2019 of $100 bills.My wife just informed me that there was a 3rd woman who was quite separate from the couple with a camera out, and the woman she took a photo of, nodded at her before leaving.

The sights, sounds and smells hit your senses.Mine was usually centered on that of roasting chestnuts at the intersection in the middle of the street. That stall is still there but the atmosphere is a lot different since KL City Hall made it a covered pedestrian mall.It was and still is a long row of stalls selling clothes, electronic goods, fake watches, handbags, souvenirs and an array of items - one that locals don't frequent owing to rude stall owners, poor quality goods and inflated prices. It is more of a tourist trap.You can be forgiven if you think you are in Dhaka and not Kuala Lumpur since most of these stalls have now been rented out and are run by Bangladeshis.It is not so Chinatown anymore - more of a a cosmopolitan town with Chinese deco I'd say. Chinese New Year and Chinese festivals are a good time to visit if you want to catch a glimpse of Chinese culture because KL's Chinatown is quite culturally diverse than it is Chinatown.Back then and even nowadays, us locals usually make our way to the shops behind the stalls - these are mostly wholesalers - toys, clothes, florists etc. Here, you get a better choice of items, and prices are fixed and reasonable (prices at the stalls can go up to three time more if you do not know how to bargain).All said and done, Petaling Street is still a place to get authentic Malaysian Chinese street food, though sometimes one needs to turn a blind eye to the lack of ambiance.If ambiance and a little history is what you are looking for - there are some small quaint cafes that you might need to check out. These have been set up in the old pre-war shop lots along the road including Merchant's Lane (a quaint cafe in what at one time was a brothel), Old China Cafe, Lucy in the Sky and Urban Artisan Cafe among others.Do visit Chinatown to catch SOME glimpses of old KL (sadly little effort has been made to preserve the rich history of this area)"

Beer was cheap hence memory a little clouded.Great people watching here too.On to the stalls, good for a look around and a barter if you fancy it. Some good quality fakes but also some horrible ones. The nike t shirts with Adidas labels were a bit of a give away. If you have a good memory try remember prices you get offered and use those prices against each vendor.For a rough guide on some pricing we paid - NBA singlets were 70MYR, Ray Bans - 120MYR (we didn't even try barter as the guy was honest and said they were fakes but good quality so we gave him credit for that), Fridge magnets 4 for 10MYR, Dress was approx two for 35MYR and scarves in pashmina if that makes sense was 3 for 50MYR.If you got better deals don't break our egos and keep them to yourself \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02"

They should call this place Kwai Loh street (foreigners street) instead. Here you can find food store, all kinds of fruits, eateries etc. One thing you got to watch out is don't take any taxi in front of the entrance because they will rip you off. Take a Grab car or a Pink Go bus for free if your hotel is in the Bukit Bintang area.

Deeply immersed in Oriental culture, heritage and history, Chinatown is undoubtedly one of the most popular tourist spots in Malaysia. Chinatown is also a well-known bargain hunter\u2019s paradise, a place where you can find all sorts of stuff from Chinese herbs to imitation goods. At night, its main market area, Petaling Street, transforms into a lively and vibrant night market, filled with hundreds of stalls offering all kinds of goods at dirt-cheap prices, and the place is usually crowded with locals as well as tourists. The best thing is, the prices can be brought lower still as haggling is the way of life here!The area has dozens of restaurants and food stalls, serving local favourites. Traders here are mainly Chinese, but there are also Indian, Malay and Bangladeshi traders. Nearby is the Jamek Mosque, an old mosque of Moorish architecture, as well as the Central Market, all accessible within walking distance. One of Kuala Lumpur's famous landmarks, the Sri Maha-Mariamman Temple, Kuala Lumpur, is located close by. It is one of KL's oldest and richest Hindu temples, receiving many devotees and tourists daily.

You can select your choice of food on the \u201cloko loko\u201d and they grill, bool or fry and bring it to your table (in front of hotel Nan Yeon)During day we just entered one of the places full with people- to us this is usually a good sign if many locals eat there. We found 2 exceptional tea stores , on Jalan Sultan (the Evergreen tea house) and at the end of the street (a wholesale tea house). In both we had excellent tea tasting and bought different tea, tea set. In the wholesale tea house at the end of Jalan Sultan they have excellent White tea and very special tea porcelain \u201cJian Zhan\u201d (black porcelain)  - we really enjoyed the tea tasting. We tried Durian and Jack fruit. For Durian I would suggest to better go to SS2 to the local market and try it there as there are different types and different quality. "

Although you will find that the merchandise is pretty much the same throughout. What you need to do is make sure that you never agree to pay whatever the shop keeper says the price is right away. They would love to get you to pay the highest price they quote. But they are willing to take a lot less. Lady's handbags can be had for about $25 if you buy them on the street. For the better quality bags, the shop owners will offer to take you to a private room in a building off the street. Don't be alarmed. You are not being taken somewhere to be robbed. The good stuff is kept locked up away from the street. Bags there are more expensive. Watches are the same. You will pay between $20 and $25 for knock-off watches on the street, but the good quality knock-offs are in a room locked up. Those can cost between $90 and $150. Bargain hard. If they won't come down to a price you are willing to pay. Leave! Find another shop and start the process over again. Unless your price point is just too low, someone may meet your price so that they can move their inventory. Food also is all over in Chinatown. Honestly, I have never eaten down there. I am pretty adventurous about what I will eat. But I have limits, and I seem to hit them when I go to Chinatown. I know that there are a couple of restaurants down there right on the main streets that are supposed to be pretty good and safe. I always stay in a hotel that is attached to two very nice malls with a myriad of great restaurant choices. So for me, I wait until I get back to my hotel before I eat. Expect Chinatown to be hot, humid and crowed. It gets even more crowed at night. But enjoy it. It is lively and fun to see what is for sale. You may find some things you hadn't considered looking for. Decide what you think a \"good\" deal would be and hold the line on your price. If they won't meet it, walk. It's only a good deal if you get if for the price you wanted to pay. Getting back to your hotel is easy. There are plenty of taxis at the end of each of the two streets that make up the primary market. Don't miss Chinatown. Enjoy it and have fun with your negotiating."

We took a taxi and the driver dropped us off right in front of the main entrance where there is a large gate with Chinese Signage put up above between two round red wooden beam (see photo). We found the street was not too busy (probably early for that time of day) .There were stalls on either side of the relatively wide footpaths which led us to a 'T' junction, We decided that we would take a left turn and walk down that side of the pathway until the end and then walk back, pass the T junction over to the other end of the pathway. The pathways were not long and we covered the first end after 10 - 15 minutes. On the way back we stopped at a freshly made waffle stall. The man makes these delicious crushed nut and sugar filled waffles. We bought some and they tasted really delicious. We also stopped by a Chinese herbal drinks stall where my wife bought us some ice cold Chinese herbal drink - very refreshing. Overall the place was not busy and I couldn't find many restaurant stall like the one at Jalan Alor. Once we walked to the other end of the pathway. we continued walking out of the 'China Town' area and stumbled across an Indian Temple and Chinese Temple. The Chinese Temple was gated and closed. The Indian Temple was opened but we did not enter the temple as there was a large crowd just entering the temple as we arrived.It was early evening when we finished wandering around the China Town part of Petaling Jalan and I found a claypot rice stall at the side of a street near Petaling Street.

Not a person who goes beyond the comfort area when it comes to food, but I tasted some of the foods of tofu/ beans / fishes. Eating by chopsticks was something memorable to me. After lunch, we roamed around Chinatown. Even in the midday, there was no shortage of live music and other performances on street. My friend offered local delicacies including beverages and pair of cake in yellow and pink colour representing reunion of two families while tying the knot in Chinese culture. We would have spent not more than an hour and half in Chinatown having lunch and roaming around in the midst of Saturday afternoon but I will cherish the experience and company of my Chinese friend for many years to come.

The hardest working man in Chinatown bakes pancakes 7 days a week all year around and has been doing this for decades. I asked if all his children were doctors and lawyers, but he only admitted one engineer. Semi precious jewellery is sold in an insence filled room, where men sit huddled over their merchandise. I was lucky to find the last remains of the vintage Indian bone jewellery I already bought last year.

They have some uncommon handbags / Watches /  shoes but no branded stuff at all. Almost all the labels are fake ones. You must start offering 50% - 60% lesser price what they actually ask for. For an example if they ask for RM130 for a handbag you must request  it for RM 40 and gradually increase and then you can buy it for about RM 60.

It is now more of a bargain shopping open-air bazaar with lots of vendors in small stands selling brand knock-offs of handbags, suitcases, purses, shoes, jeans and all sorts of gadgets. You can and are expected to bargain with the merchants for everything. Sort of like eBay on steroids! The stands are mainly manned by Bangladeshis and Myanmaris (people from Myanmar). Decades ago, KUL's Chinatown used to be filled with Chinese stores and merchants. Many of these stores are now gone, replaced or their owners have hired Bangladeshis and Myanmaris to work in lieu of being there themselves. Hence the base flavor of KUL's Chinatown has changed tremendously and along with it the authentic Chinese atmosphere.KUL's Chinatown is located in one of the oldest parts of KUL. What you will still get to experience are some of the last of the old colonial buildings. These are the last vestiges of the old architecture from the turn of the 19th century/early 20th century. There is very little preservation done to these old buildings. Eventually, they will be gone. So, you should experience and photograph them before they are torn down.If you do experience KUL's Chinatown during the day and walk the back alleys, you will experience the big wet market that sells live chickens, fish, fresh veggies and a few day restaurants (they are not open for the night crowd). The night open-air bazaar takes over most of Chinatown by dusk."

First, it is not a red light district where it is safe to bring your spouse and family to this market for shopping imitation goods and experience various local Chinese hawker food. One should be prepared to see many foreign workers such as Bangladeshi, Indonesian and Burmese are being employed to serve you. Many of the owners with origin of local Chinese background had left the scene except those selling various food. Many of the Chinese food sellers are old and had been there for more than 30 years. It is sad that the young generation are not keen to do the job. This is the reason why I say one still could enjoy local Chinese food prepared by the old Chinese hands where they are the last Chinese man standing there. Next generation Chinese meals would be replaced by other ethnic races. Some of the Chinese good are very tasty and delicious where price is still considered reasonable by local standard while some are over price due to tourist dollars. Therefore, please check the price before placing your orders. Things to try out for foreign tourists are 1) Yong Tau Foo 2) Hakka noodles 3) Claypot chicken rice 4) Chicken rice 5) wanton noodles 6) Beef noodles 7) Spicy BBQ stingray (only serves at night), 8) Char Siew (roast pork) noodles, 9) Pork Jerky and many more upcoming cafes. If you are into imitation goods, here is the place to satisfy your budget needs. Many of the foreign workers speak broken English but do not speak mandarin, hokkien or Cantonese. They are pretty fluent with Malay language though. Who should come here;1) Tourists who want to experience an atmosphere of South Asian cultural diversity where tourists from China, Middle East, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and local multicultural ethnic groups flock to this market. It is like a baby silk road market where it is also a cross road to other cultural experience.2) As Chinatown is near to the central market, Masjid Jamek and Merdeka Square. It would be great to begin your walking journey from Chinatown for breakfast or end your trip here for lunch or dinner. Transportation wise is very convenient as you could come here via Central Market LRT station. Plenty of taxis and uber/grab to service you too. 3) Street photographers would have many activities here but please do not be aggressive. People here don't ask for tips as you take photos of them doing their business but do know your limits and keep a distance help. 4) This is not a place for you if you intend to come here to learn about Chinese culture in Malaysia. For this, you have to go to Melaka and Penang Island where history is richer. Public safety at the Chinatown is of not a concerned but one must not be careless and attract unnecessary attention. Do keep your belongings close to you all the time as this is a baby silk road market."

So many stalls like this and these vendors were more pushy.  There was also some souvenir type items and of course clothing, lots of knock off clothing especially t-shirts.  The prices really varied stall to stall for similar items.  We found the marked prices or starting prices if unmarked were rather high, this is a place you will want to negotiate.  The English is quite good so that helps with back and forth to settle on a price.  We felt quite safe in and around Chinatown taking normal precautions as a tourist. The area was a good area, didn\u2019t feel rough or scary, we moved about without too much thought. We enjoyed sitting at an outdoor restaurant drinking a beer and people watching/watching the activity in the market.Chinatown is also very close in proximity to the Central Market. We would visit Chinatown again on another trip back to Kuala Lumpur."

You can buy marvellous wooden masks, pottery from many cultures, wooden bowls and dishes, festival ornaments eg Chinese New Year or Christmas depending on the season, or traditional dress, Chinese, Indian, Malaysian etc. Bargains, bargains, bargains...but you will need to go through the barter process to achieve the price you think is fair. Be fair, don't push it too far. Changing rooms are simple eg I've changed behind a curtain in a corner, but it was worth it. You will quickly be served by helpful staff and it can be overwhelming if you don't really want to buy, so my advice is, 'if you don't want to buy it, don't even try it,' They work hard to make each sale. As usual in crowded places, especially markets, keep a close eye on personal belongings, don't flash wads of cash or expensive jewellery. I felt perfectly safe with my two pretty twenty something daughters, but drew a lot of attention. Wear respectable clothing for the culture. Three ladies and no males tends to create a lot of interest in Malaysia, but we've never had a problem, be confident and stick together. Food is available on street stalls and a food hall is available. Take water, in fact in Malaysia invest in a good reusable bottle. It will save you money (and the planet)."

The chinatown I remembered as a child was busy and bustling with lots of Chinese hawkers selling their goods (be it fruits, veges, food, souvenirs etc).

        "body": "My friend needed to buy a mobile phone, then he went to Kotaraya Mall. Kotaraya is near Chinatown Petaling Street. It can be said as the same area with Chinatown Petaling street and Kasturis but separated with main roads. At Kotaraya Mall, 1st seller from official mobile phone store approached and offered him a mobile phone with the price as RM 700. The mobile phone store was looked like official with branded mobile phone logo. He said it was included free simcard, charger, power bank and cover. It was a package, he said. Because the package price looked very cheap, compared to normal price, then my friend agreed for buying the mobile phone and gave the money to seller. The 1st seller passed the money to his friend at the store.The 2nd seller appeared from the store and approached them. He said to activate the mobile phone, he offered the registration form to sign, then my friend sign the form. The other seller asked the passport number and existing phone number, and he acted to register the passport number for registration.Then the 2nd seller explained that there were different package price between the package price from the store and from mobile phone provider. He said to my friend that the phone price as RM 700 is not included for activation. So, if my friend would like to activate the phone must pay RM 1320 for internet package. But my friend insisted that he paid the price of RM 700 for the phone that was included the activation. My friend said that in anywhere, the price was included when people buy a mobile phone and the phone itself was ready to use regardless price.Then the 3rd seller appeared from somewhere and approached the crowded (my friend, 1st seller and 2nd seller) and said that it was true that the phone could not be used without activation. He said my friend could pay with installment if he could not pay 1 time payment. So, he offered to my friend the installment as RM 110 x 12 (for twelve months) by using credit card.My friend said he didn't have any credit card and kept insisting that he paid RM 700 for the phone that they promised in advance. My friend did not want to installment by using credit card. He also didn\u2019t want pay any extra money. The seller said it was ok then. But when my friend asked for his money RM 700 back, they said they could not get it back because they had already registered my friend\u2019s name and passport on the mobile provide system. It had been registered, so the money could not be returned. My friend insisted and asked them to return his money. They said my friend had signed the form and it was considered as penalty fee because of cut-off the agreement. My friend got mad and said this was a fraud and you were scumbag. He said that he would report them to police. When he asked where the police station, no one there (including all sellers from neighbor stores there), none of them gave my friend any information about the location police station. They all said you could not report to the police because you were foreigner. My friend went out from Kotaraya Mall and looked for police station. By the information from people outside Mall, finally he reached the near police station and reported to the police officer. He said that he was a student of state/national university in KL and he told his story to the police. They were a fraud syndicate group. Then suddenly, a call came into my friend\u2019s phone. My friend picked up his phone and someone said that why he reported to the police, it was no use. Then my friend said please explain it to the police.  My friend gave his phone to the police officer. The officer threatened them by saying it was a fraud and they were scumbag. Before he wrote an official police report, please return the money back. The seller said that not to make a report and he promised to return the money. Then the police cut-off the conversation and asked my friend to go there to pick up his money. My friend went back to the mobile phone store and asked, \u201cwhere is my money?\u201d One of sellers returned the money of RM 700 to my friend. Afterward, my friend left the cursed place immediately for good.So, beware of fraud syndicate around Kotaraya area as well as Chinatown Petaling Street area, because I have heard the same modus operandi with different group/team are in this area too.I love go walking, side-seeing and shopping in Kotaraya area - Chinatown Petaling Street area - Kasturi Street area. As long as you are aware the same, similar, even different type modus operandi that might be happened, every thing is gonna be alright then."

We did learn how to haggle when we were wanting to buy. We were able to purchase quite a few presents by sticking to our low offer and being prepared to walk away if they wouldn't drop their price enough. We did get one stalholder to drop the price of a leather satchel from RM385 to RM70 by not being intimidated. The restaurants are good too. Look for places the locals pack out and you should be fine.

        "body": "Kind of grew up here as a boy; when school holidays meant s holiday in KL when Dad was sent to KL for training. Chinatown, KL, has sadly lost a lot of its charm. Local Chinese traders have either sold their businesses or farmed them out to foreigners to man. It doesn't feel nor look like Chinatown anymore; when you have Indians, Nepalese and Myanmese running the gamut of this.Pros:1. Architecturally, it still resembles a Chinatown.2. The old gentleman who sells heavenly peanut pancakes is still there.3. World's Best Fried Hokkien Noodles is opposite Chinatown.4. There are still local hawker fare served up.by locals. The Curry Chicken Noodles (go for a vermicelli and yellow noodles mix), Curry Puff & Wanton Noodles are still good.5. Excellent photo opportunities. 4:30pm - 7:00pm time period gives you both day & night shots.Cons:1. Stalls are mostly operated by foreign labourers who are generally rude, obnoxious and aggressive.2. Goods are mostly from China and Thailand.3. Many local snacks and treats have disappeared. The Water Chestnut and Bean Curd stalls are still around & a must try (located in the center of the cross section).4. Most of the food served up here lacks the punch it had in the past because they are cooked up by foreign cooks (local cooks can be found along the fringe roads surrounding Chinatown).Summary:Chinatown has been reduced to a largely photo opportunity. Shopping is cheaper and of a greater variety elsewhere; like night markets for instance. Food quality has dropped drastically & generally overpriced. Jalan Alor offers better deals when it comes to food (but again, beware of the foreign cooks). I'd.make Chinatown a 3-hour (see time frame above) stop for photos. Accessible by Free Go KL (Purple Line) bus, taxi and metro (Pasar Seni station)."

The same applies for dining.I'd give the \"yong tau foo\" & \"cheong fun\" stalls in the \"middle alley\" a miss even though the locals recommend them highly. They are overrated, bland, not fresh and overpriced.I still go for the peanut pancake.(RM1 a piece), \"muah chee\" - sticky dough rolled in crushed peanuts & sugar (RM5 a pack), \"wanton meen\" - barbequed pork and dumplings with egg noodles (RM8 for a big portion), Fried Hokkien Noodles (RM 10 for a small portion) - only the stall found opposite Chinatown that's cooked by a local Chinese cooked & Curry Chicken Noodles (RM6 per bowl).Shopping: Stuff is mostly from Thailand & China.Great photo opportunities in the late afternoon and evenings though."

Please do your bargain here when you are buying things but make sure you buy when you get the price you want.Otherwise you will get it from the rowdy sellers and many are foreigners too. You can try the street food but the proper restaurants nearby which mostly is occupied by tourist may charge you the tourist price, if you know what I meant.Happy holidays!"

However, the Petaling Street I remember is one of food and more glorious food! Today though, stalls peddling bags, T-Shirts, souvenirs and trinkets rule the street. As a child, I was always bright-eyed and always pleasantly welcomed by sights, smells and sounds of this oh so \"adventurous\" place! Yes, going to Petaling Street was always viewed as a mini adventure. Having seen the night markets in several other countries however, I am now of the sad opinion that Petaling Street can't measure up to those in Hongkong, Siem Reap, Hatyai, or Singapore. Much needs to be done for Petaling Street to reclaim its former glory!"

My Indian friends, let me tell you (and I am qualified as I have spent six decades here), the bargains at Lajpat Nagar and Sarojini Nagar are much more attractive, both from the price and quality point of view. The plus points are that the place is expectedly very congested with plenty of food options of all choices ranging from pure vegetarian to the steaks. I got a chance to speak with some visitors. The general psychology was that not buying anything from here would be infra dig. Get rid of that feeling and try out the wide variety of edibles on the street itself and surroundings.I had my first taste of the  notoriously famous fruit Durien here, and loved the taste!  Unlike a general impression, quite different from the jackfruit. Has some great freshly extracted suger cane juice too.  And of course many other things including tea from a giant kettle.An important piece of advice: Once you are done with the China Town, DO NOT MISS the Pasar Seni as well as the over 125-year-old Central Market. You could be in for some very pleasant surprises including delicious \"Paratha with Alu Dam\" at the legendary Old Town White Coffee outlet."

We were asked to come to a separate stall with high quality goods, and as we were with 5 persons, we took the chance to look at higher quality merchandise away from the main street. It was worth the visit. Take the challenge and be very set in the price you want to pay for an item, and you will be surprised what difference there is between asking price and sale price."

        "body": "I cannot say how people will rank this as excellent/very good etc. Its a combination of narrow streets which get narrower as you walk in. Street stalls selling counterfeit and imitation watches (some with good quality), bags, clothing, jewelry etc. In the beginning there are a few large organized shops at the back of the stalls where you can shop specially for jewelry and they are nice. Then there are good and bad sellers - some are down rude and some deal pleasantly. Go around and find bargains for good quality imitation watches. Whatever number they quote you come back with half of it and at times they just agree on that. I know for a fact that this place is far cheaper than Bukit Bintang or other places in KL. Also I did get a few watches on my last trip which asfter 5 years are still in good shape and perfectly working well. You just need to examine the items closely, look at various stalls and then make up your mind what to get. Being crowded with narrower streets, go prepared as it its somewhat stinky and some or the youngsters just roaming there are actually eyeing your bag/belongings. So be careful !Its totally unorganized and I cannot seem to see the logic of taking a guided tour or something like this. Dont wast your money on that. Just go prepared and you will come back with a lots of good quality imitation goods."

The local chinese seem to have outsource their business. What used to be a rich cultural experience has now become purely business oriented; even so, there is a need to be very cautious about price versus quality...at times, these \"foreign migrants\" are rude...these goods, already fake, are still \"swapped\" during packing to a lower grade...prices inflated! Be mindful of surroundings as snatch thieves and pick pockets are loitering...seeking opportunities; would be wise to haveca good handle of purse, wallets, bracelets and gold chains. Having said this, there are still a couple of genuine faithful chinese proudly operating here since the chinatown of old; business handed down from generations. These, one must try. The \"mata kucing\" drink stall at the corner, near the main entrance, is still the best. Opposite, there is a soya bean drink seller; also try their smooth \"tau foo fah\"...soy bean custard. Within the vicinity is a humble stall near Olaiya BBQ roast pork, known as \"Char Wong\"...roughly translated as Tea King...serving the best local coffee and tea...be it hot or cold. Yes, the BBQ roast pork slices is also to crave for. Further down the street towards the opposite end...one can find a chinese lady manning small little push cart stall selling the most delicious roast duck...\"sei ngan chai\" it is commonly known. Be sure to try the roast duck feet wrapped with duck liver and meat...held together with duck intestine. As awful as this may sound, it simply taste awesome. Must pack some home...goes well with a couple of cold beer! This is just a short take on what used to be Chinatown in KL. Still worth a stroll..."

It is still a good place to get fakes that look real but i would only recommend it if you have nothing else to do. Otherwise there are other malls in city centre like Sungei Wang and the night markets opposite it that serve the same purpose and nicer people"

There is very little left of what once was Chinatown, it's now BanglaTown, and only recommended if you want counterfeit goods which you can get some great purchases Top tip - DO NOT buy what's on display AT ALL. This is the WORST quality cheapest goods, ask them to show you the best quality bags and watches as they have more stock in the back. Do not ever buy display goods they are of disgusting quality and I could make them myself. Buy from their showrooms or stockrooms - and remember, ALWAYS haggle! If they offer a silly price just turn around and walk away - another stall will sell the exact same thing and might offer you a better price, a top tip for bagging is to say 'your friends stall over there offered me '....' insert a reasonable price you're willing to pay.

First up, it's the rice noodles (cheecheongfun) stores along the main junction of the street that offers squabbling owners trying to attract customers, surely this happens throughout the day, they can get quite loud at times. Next, enjoying a nice cup of coffee further down the street of a store naming themselves The King of Tea. Would recommend to try and judge for yourself. Walking around the street and snapping the hustle and bustle of a street gearing up for a full day of business was an enthralling experience. This place has the charm of the olden Kuala Lumpur while the modernity is slowly trying to bust out. It's good to be a witness to history in writing."

I rarely see any Chinese there, rather Nepalese / Burmese / Bangladeshi / Sri Lankan etc mending the stalls. They even prepares and serves the local favourite dishes, surely well trained by the respective food stall owners! Some can speak the local language, Bahasa & even Chinese dialects, but minimal English. Sadly, it no longer has the old Chinatown ethnic enclave of Chinese. It's a pity to lose this cultural touch. Overall, the place is still very much the same when I first visited in 1993, except running by foreigners instead of locals. Selling imitation branded goods, cheap souvenirs made in China, and wide selection of local foods, which is very affordable. It's worth a trip just for an experience, if you're in KL. "

The key thing is to agree the price before you try anything on and make sure the kids know not to say too much as they latch onto the kids and make it harder to bargain.  We got some good 'polo' shirts/lookalikes for a couple of pounds.

There are departmental stores as well, with labelled price tags - so if you are looking for a good price but do not want to get into bargaining, these stores are ideal. Really inexpensive stuff - depends on what you are looking for. Shops are roadside are bargain friendly (start with 50% was what I was told by a local) - stores on the sides have fixed price tag (with good variety).

If you want to avoid the crowds the. Early morning is best. The compromise here is the atmosphere just isn't quite the same. We had some delicious food and a couple of large beers at one of the street stalls. The portions were big and the food tasted better than any Chinese food I have tasted at home.

Behind the street stalls you will find old retail establishments selling inexpensive merchandise of all type including indigenous Chinese products, medicine, fabric, gems, china.These days though there are more Bangladesh, Indian, Pakistani hawkers than Chinese. And whoever the salesman, be prepared to bargain. If they start at 300 RM, say you cant pay more than 80 or 100. Then say you ll buy two whats the best price. They ll come down even more. Then pretend to walk away or check elsewhere, he ll give you an even better rate until he settles mid way. But only ask price if you are really interested in buying, some salesmen take great offence if you ask price and then dont follow through. And some of these guys can get a bit rough if they get ticked off. Watch out for your pocket and belongings though, stay clear of secluded alleys/corners. Take a bagpack to carry what you buy, and take plenty of water. And while you get a great bargain for whatever you buy dont expect world class products.

I have even seen myself while having a coffee next to a fake brand store that two Malaysian ladies asked the price of an item and the shop keeper while bargaining with them said that this is the cheapest as you know in this market we charge different prices for tourists and different prices for locals. So beware. When they see your face they charge you 10x more and even after bargaining they have still overcharged you. They also have a habit of luring you into their shop and forcing you to buy from them and when u dont they abuse you. They make you feel trapped in their shop. They insult you and swear when you leave their shop so all the other shop keepers can hear, to make those shop keepers think you are a bad customer. It is not a crime to look and not buy, so you do not deserve this.Do not get involved in this cheap market. Its not worth the trauma. You can walk past to get the experience but do not engage with the cheap quality shop keepers who have no respect whatsoever. In one shop I had asked the price of an item and because I didnt buy it when I left he started screaming 'cheap' and 'rubbish' down the road at me. After speaking to many other foreigners in the food court we all shared the same experience about how bad the market is and how we will never come back.

We as a family decided to head to chinatown on our last night in KL before we headed back to Heathrow and then onto another connecting flight. As I walked down pass the stalls selling everything from fish heads to football jerseys I decided (before I passout from heatstroke) that we needed a drink. We sat outside the \"foodhall\" deciding where to go for dinner. After a couple of drinks we decided to hell with it !! We would try the local food hall how bad could it be ... The food hall is a tent with all the locals each selling their own food you order (make sure to ask how much it is after you have finished giving your order) as you dont pay till it comes to your table. The food was superb total bill \u20ac12.00 for 5 people. We ended up being the very last to leave. Its not the cleanest looking but the food is fresh and we didnt get ill...Result !! and it was a night I will remember for a long time so be adventerous."

I recommend this place if you want to search for cheap souvenir or look for fake product but looks like original. Try your hard to bargain the price twice cheaper than its given, because sellers will give you ridiculous prices at first. If you like to play 'hard to get' this place is is perfect for you. When your bargained price is not acceptable but you still thought it's acceptable, pretend to go, then the seller will give in and give you the price you wanted.In my experience, it's more ridiculous. I captivated by this small red bag, branded one (of course fake). I asked for price and he gave me RM 150. It's ridiculous then I started to babling about how bad the quality is, I asked for 70 but he won't give in. So I left the place then after a bit further, he called me to say it's ok for 70. But, my dignity told me not to come back, so I didn't. Then he then shouted out to lower the price till RM50. In the end I didn't come back tho."

Dont take the 1st or 2nd price as being the price. If you dont mind haggling you can walk out with a suitcase full of stuff. ( Literally one of the girls with us bought that much that she then haggled for a suitcase to buy to fit it all in to take home ) we had lots of fun here and had lots of laughs with the locals.Micahel Cors hand bags Lui Vuitton etc... sunglasses ray bans/ versace etx on offer.Be nice to them not to aggressive and you can walk out with some amazing deals.Keep your wallets and handbags out of sight so you dont get pick pocketed.Mens and Ladies watches. anything you can think of even dvds of course copies you probably buy 10 dvds and 2 arent good quality but the rest are you can get then for roughly $2 - $3 a movie. You can generally get new release movies.There is a good food court with cheap local food if you are game enough to try it.Take a bottle of water with you as you will build up a sweat in the heat shopping.Always love coming back to KL to come to China Town its a must everytime we come here."

Fake brand sunglasses, belts, t-shirts, bags etc. all abound. But there are areas of KL less notorious and less tourist-trap than this. Ask Malaysian friends to take you to a good pasar malam where you'll find most of these items anyway.TIP FOR TRAVEL: Got Uber? Use it.
