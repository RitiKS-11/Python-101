At the end we felt we'd been in Malaysia for years already and knew the culture really well. It also felt like we'd been to 3 different cities, with visiting a Chinese food street, an Indian area and a very local Malay settlement. The tour guide and the drivers are very knowledgeable and also interested in us. We spent so much time talking that sometimes one of the drivers had to remind us to go to the next stop.<br />The food was all delicious, tried a lot of new things and it was very varied.",

We tried all kinds of exciting food and drinks, saw amazing areas and sights and generally had a fantastic time! A brilliant and fun way to experience the city. Highly recommended!

Kingston and Das took me to three different spots, thoughtfully curated such that I get to try Chinese food, Indian food and Malaysian food at spots that are frequented by locals (I didn't see a single tourist at these spots, other than myself of course). You'll get to try numerous dishes throughout the few hours, so best to eat a bit of each and leave room for the next few stops. Through the wide variety of food, you really get a taste of the diversity that makes Malaysia unique. <br /><br />Along the way, you'll also get to visit landmark spots in KL, and at each place, Kingston shares pockets of Malaysian history and the importance of what you're seeing. Learned so much from this tour! And the best part of it is the passion that the guides have. You can really tell they love sharing knowledge about Malaysia and genuinely enjoying chatting with you. The cherry on top, of course, is that you get to ride a vespa throughout the city. Say what! Cute photos of you on the vespa are guaranteed to impress your instagram followers ;)",

At the end we felt we'd been in Malaysia for years already and knew the culture really well. It also felt like we'd been to 3 different cities, with visiting a Chinese food street, an Indian area and a very local Malay settlement. The tour guide and the drivers are very knowledgeable and also interested in us. We spent so much time talking that sometimes one of the drivers had to remind us to go to the next stop.<br />The food was all delicious, tried a lot of new things and it was very varied.",

We got picked up and dropped off at our hotel, we zoomed around KL snaking in and out of traffic (very exciting), our guides Lisa and Kingston were amazing and the very patient, lovely Vespa drivers were superb! We tried all kinds of exciting food and drinks, saw amazing areas and sights and generally had a fantastic time! A brilliant and fun way to experience the city. Highly recommended!
