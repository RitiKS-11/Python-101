So, we booked this tour to help us pass the time. <br /><br />The only thing visitors should know and the only suggestion I have is that Kuala Lumpur's Central market is quite a massive building and it can be hard to locate your meeting point. After calling our guide, Siddoz it was decided to meet up at the information desk, which is an easy to locate landmark within the Central market. I would suggest that the information desk meeting point should be specified in the ticket.<br /><br />Other than that though, everything went well. Malay, Indian and Chinese Street food are all located very close to each other near the Central market area and depending on your tastes you can specify what you would like to try and the guide will adjust your tour accordingly.<br /><br />Our guide, Siddoz knew both the locals and the foods very well and each dish was peppered with tales of the culture and the history from which it originated as well as the context in which different cultures arrived in Malaysia.<br /><br />In terms of food, i would definitely recommend the curry laksa, nasi lemak and pork buns. <br /><br />Lastly, if you have food allergies or religious prohibitions from trying certain foods, just remember to inform your guide at the beginning and they will accommodate accordingly. <br /><br />We booked the tour because we had some time to kill but consider how good our experience was, I would recommend this tour to anyone who comes to KL.",

Although we paid for 2 people, we were given one portion to share in each place and we had to even cut small deserts by two to try it (I think it was a good saving on us). We went to Indian place, then tried noodles in the market, then tried bacon, 2 fruits and soya desert. On the way, we were also offered an ice cream (was supposed to be shared again with my 15 yo son, but I asked to have two separate). Overall, I think the trip is interesting but overpriced for what it offers, I had to eat when I was back home.",

        "body": "We took this tour right after landing in Kuala Lumpur. Unfortunately our flight came in at 7:15am and our hotel check in was at 2pm. Even after immigration, customs, breakfast and the long ride from the airport to KL Sentral we still had a good 4 hours to go before check in. So, we booked this tour to help us pass the time. <br /><br />The only thing visitors should know and the only suggestion I have is that Kuala Lumpur's Central market is quite a massive building and it can be hard to locate your meeting point. After calling our guide, Siddoz it was decided to meet up at the information desk, which is an easy to locate landmark within the Central market. I would suggest that the information desk meeting point should be specified in the ticket.<br /><br />Other than that though, everything went well. Malay, Indian and Chinese Street food are all located very close to each other near the Central market area and depending on your tastes you can specify what you would like to try and the guide will adjust your tour accordingly.<br /><br />Our guide, Siddoz knew both the locals and the foods very well and each dish was peppered with tales of the culture and the history from which it originated as well as the context in which different cultures arrived in Malaysia.<br /><br />In terms of food, i would definitely recommend the curry laksa, nasi lemak and pork buns. <br /><br />Lastly, if you have food allergies or religious prohibitions from trying certain foods, just remember to inform your guide at the beginning and they will accommodate accordingly. <br /><br />We booked the tour because we had some time to kill but consider how good our experience was, I would recommend this tour to anyone who comes to KL.",
