        "body": "This tour was the surprise highlight of our KL trip!  My girlfriend and I had such a memorable time with Dass/Kelvin as we explored the city center by bike.  The Vespa ride through the crowded streets of KL was fun and at certain points thrilling as we weaved through the traffic.  Dass/Kelvin kept us safe during the entirety of the ride.  We were able to enjoy the city lights and attractions at night, when the weather was cooler and there was less people.  We went to spots both local and tourist in nature, spots with rich history, spots we wouldn\u2019t have seen without their guidance.  Dass/Kelvin helped to give us a better appreciation of the diverse culture, history and food scene present in KL.  Much thanks to these two for the experience!  We wouldrecommended it to anyone looking to explore the city limits!",

        "body": "Our passionate guides (Kelvin, Des, Azmi) showed us a KL like we never would have seen alone. The food spots we stopped at were little local joints. We had Chinese/malay, Indian/malay, and Malay food. Everything was DELICIOUS! We tried durian and lots of tropical fruits. We went to little laneways to see street art and to independence square. Through out Kelvin shared the history of KL with us (from architecture to politics) The bikes were great fun, having never ridden before I was nervous but the guys were very safe and made meFeel at ease. I would 100 percent recommend this experience to everyone. Kelvin and des clearly have a huge passion for their city and were joyful to be around.",

I tried the spiciest, tastiest laksa at our first stop, along with some delicious freshly made noodles at Pudu Wai Sek Kai. Kelvin managed to accommodate all my food requests. He even picked up some durian when I said I hadn\u2019t tried it - was better than anticipated! Would highly recommend this tour as an intro into the KL food scene/ nightlife.",

At the end we felt we'd been in Malaysia for years already and knew the culture really well. It also felt like we'd been to 3 different cities, with visiting a Chinese food street, an Indian area and a very local Malay settlement. The tour guide and the drivers are very knowledgeable and also interested in us. We spent so much time talking that sometimes one of the drivers had to remind us to go to the next stop.<br />The food was all delicious, tried a lot of new things and it was very varied.",

You'll get to try numerous dishes throughout the few hours, so best to eat a bit of each and leave room for the next few stops. Through the wide variety of food, you really get a taste of the diversity that makes Malaysia unique. <br /><br />Along the way, you'll also get to visit landmark spots in KL, and at each place, Kingston shares pockets of Malaysian history and the importance of what you're seeing. Learned so much from this tour! And the best part of it is the passion that the guides have. You can really tell they love sharing knowledge about Malaysia and genuinely enjoying chatting with you. The cherry on top, of course, is that you get to ride a vespa throughout the city. Say what! Cute photos of you on the vespa are guaranteed to impress your instagram followers ;)",

As with all things nature, its a bit of luck on whether you interact with monkeys and see fireflies. The success for our tour really comes down our driver and guide LG. It was raining in KL, it was a Saturday, traffic was bad meaning timing was tight, but we still got to through the itinerary, we didn't feel rushed, LG gave just the right amount of commentary, got us up Melawati Hill, and liaised with the boat company to get us sorted on the busy jetty. A very safe pair of hands. Re: the fireflies, there is a number of reviews that question whether its worth the tour. IMHO, sure they are like low wattage xmas lights, I'd recommend doing it if you haven't seen them before and because its an experience in a new country on top of the temple, hill, monkeys, commentary and boat ride.",
