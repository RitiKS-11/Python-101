While in Kuala Lumpur we took private half day: The Ultimate Kuala Lumpur Food Tour with our excellent tour guide Ranita. She was so knowledgeable about history, culture and multicultural foods of Malaysia. We started from China Town tasting various Chinese Cuisines. Walked towards Malay neighbourhood tasting delicious Malaysian Foods.  Then last stop was Indian food. As we were walking she showed us many interesting and historical sites of the city. On our way we visited many temples, and appreciated street art.  Food was plentiful and delicious. Ranita was very knowledgeable and fun to talk to. Ranita was a great conversationalist, we wish we could spend more time with her.  We highly recommend this tour. Thank you Ranita for all the information and an excellent food tour!!",

Hakim is a great tour guide, friendly, and very knowledgeable about all things KL. I tend to ask a lot of random rapid-fire questions and Hakim was well up to the task. Whether it be Malaysian social demographics, KL\u2019s real estate market, or even the history of the Malaysian flag, there wasn\u2019t anything that Hakim couldn\u2019t speak on. The food we ate was wonderfully diverse and delicious, just make sure you bring an appetite as you\u2019ll be eating several lunches throughout the tour! It was a pleasure to experience the culture of KL through its food with Hakim and I recommend anyone coming to the city to check him out. ",

It<br />seemed like most times when trying new foods in the market we didn't<br />know what we were eating or we couldn't fully communicate with the<br />stall owner because of a language barrier.   With 10 tasting tours by<br />With Locals  our experience completely changed. For started we had a<br />personalized private tour with our amazing host Hakim. Hakim broke<br />down history and culture content of the food while touring around.<br />Running around to different food stalls with a local gave us the<br />chance to explore off the road places, we wouldn't have found or even<br />tried without a recommendation. 10 Tastings left us feeling like a pro<br />for the rest of our stay in Malaysia because we knew which dishes and<br />yummy treats to pick out ourselves.",

She took us to a few significant sites along the way (a temple, a mosque, the point of the rivers' confluence, etc.), explaining the history/lore in detail, and brought us to amazing food! From street vendors hawking their coconut pancakes and fresh soy milk, to sit down restaurants serving hot masala chai tea and dosa with delicious sauces, we ate it all! We ended up near the Petronas Towers and got to experience an outdoor festival where fasting Malays were stocking up on delicious foods for breaking their Ramadan daily fast. May gladly took tons of photos of us along the way to document the experience for us to share with our friends at home. I also appreciate that she is very eco-conscious, encouraging the vendors we met to use less plastic, and bringing along washable cups/metal straws for us to use instead of plastic. She is so knowledgeable both about food and about Kuala Lumpur and Malaysia generally. Any other kind of walking tour would be boring after this one! Thank you, May, for a delicious and exciting excursion! I can't recommend her enough! Would be fun to do this tour with friends or maybe even with kids (not being a parent, I don't know, but May is super friendly). You do walk a lot, so wear comfortable walking shoes and come hungry!",
