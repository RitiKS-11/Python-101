        "body": "As the title suggests, not a great deal has changed over the years in Chinatown. I did notice on my recent visit that there is now a roof covering much of the area. I cannot remember seeing this on my last visit. Although that was quite a few years ago.Probably because on The Internet I did not spot a single vendor selling D.V.Ds. However, there are still more than enough stalls selling cheap watches to please even the most fastidious visitor. There appear to be more stalls selling pirated clothing and accessories now than before, but then again it could very well be because of my not being here for a while. As before though, this place is heaving, and it is difficult to wander among some of the stalls because of so many visitors.One thing that has always tickled us is the chap selling roast chestnuts right in the middle of Chinatown. Roasted chestnuts are not something normally associated with a tropical country like Malaysia.",

Haggle with the stall workers over prices as they will highball you but you can get a great quality knock off bag for AU$30 - $40.   It's really hot and humid so either go when it opens or go at night.  Haggle with taxi drivers for the best price when taking your shopping back to your hotel.",

Cheap tour, but you must read about the places visited as the driver information are very limited. Our tour was less than 3 hours. Total in the car 4 people. Perhaps a larger number of tourist will provide a better guidance. The tour is very good bargain given the places visited.<br />The tour includes visits/gentle sale pitch to 3 places. We refused to go to the third. Driver offer ed to drop us off in a place we wanted: China town.",
