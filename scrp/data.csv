Has changed little over the years,Sep 2023 • Solo,"As the title suggests, not a great deal has changed over the years in Chinatown. I did notice on my recent visit that there is now a roof covering much of the area. I cannot remember seeing this on my last visit. Although that was quite a few years ago.Probably because on The Internet I did not spot a single vendor selling D.V.Ds. However, there are still more than enough stalls selling cheap watches to please even the most fastidious visitor. There appear to be more stalls selling pirated clothing and accessories now than before, but then again it could very well be because of my not being here for a while. As before though, this place is heaving, and it is difficult to wander among some of the stalls because of so many visitors.One thing that has always tickled us is the chap selling roast chestnuts right in the middle of Chinatown. Roasted chestnuts are not something normally associated with a tropical country like Malaysia."
Fake paradise,Oct 2023 • Family,Very difficult to find rest rooms.. everything is perfectly fake. Very crowded. Bargaining is a must.
Not so great anymore,Nov 2023 • Family,Be ready to be disappointed. No more chinese rather cox bazaar with all Bangladeshi crowd and sellers. No more the great place it used to be with Chinese shops and banter.
Commercial street,Aug 2023 • Couples,"KL's Chinatown is more than just a commercial street, but almost all the activities are focused there. You'll find stores, restaurants, people walking up and down… it's very alive"
Average market but some good food,Oct 2023 • Couples,"Market stalls highly repetitive, clothes, bags, lots of fake branded goods, sellers are not too pushy which is good. There are some good cheap places to eat around though."
MUST SEE VISIT IN KL,Sep 2023 • Friends,"A great place to haggle and buy cheap knock offs of label brand bags, shirts, shorts, shoes, watches and perfumes.  A great experience and went 3 times as I have a bag fetish.  Haggle with the stall workers over prices as they will highball you but you can get a great quality knock off bag for AU$30 - $40.   It's really hot and humid so either go when it opens or go at night.  Haggle with taxi drivers for the best price when taking your shopping back to your hotel."
Petaling Street,Sep 2023 • Friends,"This is the second name for Petaling street. Mainly Chinese shops, hundreds of them along with food stalls, juices, souvenirs and others."
CHINATOWN FOR GOOD STREET FOOD AND CHEAP BUYS,Sep 2023 • Friends,Chinatown was a target area for our food tasting trip.We were surprised at the wide choices for low price branded garments and hand bags.The street food stalls open only in the evening near jalan heng jibat end.There is a popular soya bean stall. Nearby is the famous Kim Lian Kee Restaurant at Petaling Street. The famous KL hokien mee is their signature offering.Typical Chinatown ambience with hordes of tourists looking for Chinese food and good buys.
Shop shop and shop,May 2023 • Family,"Shop till you drop ! the whole lane is a treasure box of beach wear, souvenirs, sun glasses, bags, hats, clothes, suitcases and what not! This is the place you can bargain up to even half the price at some places. We bought so many souvenirs and also bought a cute cabin luggage from a Chinese shopkeeper.  This is a must place if you are interested in flea or street market. "
Unmissable,Jun 2023 • Solo,"An unmissable aspect of KL, whether you are a shopper or a culture vulture, Chinatown offers you an excellent peek into the lifestyles of the Chinese with its array of shopping & dining options. A few Chinese temples abound as well. "
